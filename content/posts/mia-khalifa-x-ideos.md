Invention's Definition: How invention works
Invention is a process by which something new and unknown is developed. Invention can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition seems to be that it is the creation of something new, whether it is an invention of a new product or a new way of doing something. Inventors are often creative minds who come up with ideas for products or methods that would never have been considered before.
