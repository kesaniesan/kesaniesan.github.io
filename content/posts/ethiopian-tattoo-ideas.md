History of Invention: From prehistoric times to the present day
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think and do things. From prehistoric times, there was evidence of people trying to come up with new ideas and inventions. Inventions have helped us achieve many things, from making everyday items more efficient and easier to creating new technologies that have made life more difficult for enemies or even our own countries. Throughout the years, different people have tried to come up with new ideas and inventions, but no one has been able to completely invent everything. Some inventions are just better than others, while others may not have had a very wide impact. But overall, invention has always been a key part of human history.
