How to get started with big ideas?
If you're looking to start making big ideas, one of the best ways to do it is by learning how to brainstorm. A lot can be gained from practicing brainstorming, especially if you want to come up with ideas for projects or products that are both new and innovative. Here are a few tips on how to get started: 
1. Make a list of key ideas 
This is probably the most important step in brainstorming, as it will help you determine which ones you should keep in mind for further consideration. Once you have a few key ideas, it's time to begin working on developing them into full-blown concepts. 
2. Take some time for yourself 
When brainstorming, it's important not to spend too much time just thinking about what other people might think or feel about your idea.

nexpected Ways to Generate Ideas:
Big ideas are the seeds of change that can have a significant impact on society and businesses. By constantly thinking about new, innovative ways to solve problems and create value, companies and societies can rise to new heights. Here are 7 possible ways to generate big ideas: 1. Think outside the box: when it comes to problem-solving, there’s no limit to what you can imagine. come up with concepts or products that have never been thought of before. Even if your idea is nothing more than a wild guess, it still could be the next big thing. 2. Rethink how you do things: changes in business or society often come about through innovations in how we do things rather than from scratch. How we organize our work space, how we communicate with customers, how we pay employees – all of these factors play into how our businesses operate.
