Tips for post formatting and design:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your article to say. What topics do you want to cover? How do you want people to feel after reading it? Do you want it to be a tutorial, an overview, or a comprehensive guide?
2. Choose the right style for your article. There are many different ways to write an article, and there is no one style that is best for all situations. You can use a simple, straight-forward layout or you can go for something more experimental and stylish.

3. Use formatting features wisely. When writing articles, always use grammar and punctuation correctly. This will help readers understand your piece and stay on target throughout the entire process.

4. Avoid using clichés and other easy-to-spot errors.

Introduce the topic of invention ideas
Most people never think about invention ideas until they see a commercial for a new product on television. Even then, the average person rarely stops to think about how that product was created or what it took to bring it to market. The process of invention is one that takes a lot of time, energy and dedication. Inventors are some of the most creative people in the world. They look at the world around them and see problems that need to be solved.
Invention ideas can come from anywhere. Sometimes inventors are inspired by nature, other times they see a problem and work to find a solution. There are also times when an inventor comes up with an idea for a product that is completely new and unique. No matter where the idea comes from, all inventions start with an idea.

The first step in turning an idea into an invention is doing some research.
