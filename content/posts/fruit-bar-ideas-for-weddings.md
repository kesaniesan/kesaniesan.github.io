The definition of creativity
Creativity is an intangible quality that many people seek to define. However, any definition of creativity must have at least one key component - the inspiration and motivation to produce something new. In today's society, creativity is often praised for its ability to inspire change, but it can also be used to create things that are commercially successful. The definition of creativity will change over time as more and more evidence is brought to light that creative art has a number of benefits beyond simply making people happy.

The power of creativity: how does creativity work?
Creativity is an intricate and often mysterious process that goes beyond the simple act of creating. It involves a deep understanding of the creative process, as well as the individual’s own personality and environment. This understanding can be gained through years of practice or by simply thinking about creativity in new ways.
There are many theories about creativity, but one that has been dominant for many years is the Creative Art Theory. This theory suggests that creativity comes from a combination of two things: the artist’s own ideas and the environment they are working in. The artist creates what they see and hear in their surroundings, then uses this information to create their own masterpiece. The environment also plays a role in creativity, by providing ideas and inspiration to the artist. When these two elements combine, it leads to a unique piece of art that can be enjoyed by anyone who visits it.
