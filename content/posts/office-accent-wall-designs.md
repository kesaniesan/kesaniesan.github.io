Business: What is the significance of invention?
Invention is the process of creating something new or change in a product or service. Inventions can be either small or large, and they can come from anyone in the business world. Some of the most famous inventions include the Telephone, the Computer, and the Television. There are many different reasons why an invention might be important, and each invention has its own importance. For example, a Telephone might not have been possible without ideas from John Lennon, and a Computer might not have been possible without help from Intel. 
There are also many different types of inventions that could be made, such as Medical Devices, Toys for Kids, and Food Processing Systems. The significance of any one invention depends on how it can be used by businesses to improve their operations or make their products more marketable.
