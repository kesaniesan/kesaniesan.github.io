Patenting an invention: How do you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of filing a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application can be filed in many different forms, but it is most commonly filed as a “patent application.”
When you file your patent application, you will need to provide a detailed description of your invention. This description will need to include everything from your name and contact information to the inventions that you are claiming. You will also need to provide enough evidence to support your claims.

Once you have submitted your patent application, the USPTO will review it and make any decisions necessary for approval. Once the USPTO approves your patent, you will then have to receive permission from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to sell or offer for sale your invention.

How can we come up with big ideas?
The best ideas come from a brainstorming session. Sometimes, it’s just easier to think broad thoughts when you have a lot of different ideas in your head. Here are some tips on how to come up with big ideas:
1. Get organized: When you have a lot of different ideas in your head, it can be difficult to remember which ones are the most important. The best way to organize these ideas is by having a main idea and then going from there. This will help you keep track of what you’re working on and make sure that it’s always relevant to your main idea.

2. Take advantage of technology: Technology has helped us massively in the past when it comes to coming up with big ideas. By using tools like Google Earth or yellow boards, we can easily brainstorm and keep track of our thoughts as we go.
