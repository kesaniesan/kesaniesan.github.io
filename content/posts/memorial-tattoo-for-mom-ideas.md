Introduce the topic of creative ideas.
Creative ideas are the core of what drives businesses and industries. They are what inspire people to come up with new products, services, and ways of doing things. Many businesses have creative departments or teams whose sole purpose is to generate new ideas.
There are a number of ways to generate new ideas. One is brainstorming, which is when a group of people get together and try to come up with as many ideas as possible, without judging or critiquing them. Another way is to look at what other businesses are doing and see if there’s something you can improve upon or do differently.

You can also try asking customers or clients what they would like to see from your business. Sometimes the best ideas come from the people who are actually using your products or services. And don’t forget about your employees!

How do you know if your ideas are big enough?
Big ideas can be hard to come by, but they can be incredibly powerful. If you have a great idea for a new product or service, the first step is to find the right people to create it and market it. Once you've got your idea out there, it'll be up to you to see if it becomes a reality. If you're not sure if your idea is big enough, there are a few ways to determine whether or not it's possible to execute successfully. 
The first way is through market research. This process involves collecting data about what people want and how they feel about products or services. Once you've gathered this information, you can begin developing an idea for something that will appeal to all types of people. 

Another way of determining whether or not your idea is big enough is through financial analysis.
