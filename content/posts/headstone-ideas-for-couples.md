The history and definition of creative art: From the ancient Greeks to the 20th century
There is no one definition of creative art that can encompass everything that may be considered creative. However, the term “creative” has been used to refer to various activities throughout history. From ancient Greeks to the 20th century, there have been many different definitions of what creativity means. However, one common definition of creativity is “the ability to produce something new and original.” This definition encompasses a wide range of activities, from creating works of art to coming up with new ideas for products or services.
One example of creativity in the ancient Greeks was the use of artistic creation in order to communicate messages. The artist was often used as a medium for discussing important concepts such as justice and morality. The Ancient Greeks also believed that music and dance could be used as forms of creativity in order to express themselves.

How can people come up with big ideas that will help them achieve their goals?
People often come up with ideas for big goals in different ways – some through brainstorming, others through cold hard thinking. It can be difficult to know where to start when trying to come up with big ideas, but here are a few tips that could help:
1. Keep your big idea simple: When you have a bunch of ideas floating around your head, it can be hard to focus on just one. Break your goal down into smaller, more manageable chunks and work on one at a time. This will make it easier to see the connection between them and make sure you are actually on the same page as your team or clients.

2. Be creative: If you’re not always comfortable following through with your ideas, try giving them a whirl some other way. What if you turned this idea into a reality?
