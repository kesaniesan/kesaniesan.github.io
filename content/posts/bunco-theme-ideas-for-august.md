The Types of Ideas: What are the three main types of creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere. They can be found in everything from advertising to architecture to the arts. But what are the three main types of creative ideas? Here are a few examples:
1. Product idea: A product is an idea that a business or individual has for selling its product. A product can be something as simple as a new phone case or a new restaurant dish.

2. Concept idea: A concept is an idea that a business or individual has for creating a new product or service. Concepts can be anything from innovative to unique to futuristic.

3. Design idea: A design is an idea that comes after someone has created some sketches and drawings of what they want their product or service to look like. Designs can range from simple to complex, and they can also be based on existing products or services.

What To Do When You Have an Idea: What to do with it?
There are a few things you can do when you have an idea for something to do. The first is to make sure that it's something that you're interested in, and second is to see if there's anyone who can help you with it. If you don't have any help from others, or if someone you know is already working on something similar, the third step is to come up with a plan of how you'll go about doing it. The fourth step is to make sure that your idea is something that people will want to do. If your idea isn't something people are excited about, they might not be willing to invest time and energy into it. The fifth step is to find someone who can helpyou execute your idea. This could be someone who has experience in the field, or someone who can helpyou come up with more specific ideas.

What are some common mistakes people make when starting a blog?
There are a few common mistakes people make when starting a blog, and the most important thing is to be aware of them so that you don’t make them. Here are some mistakes to watch out for:
1. Not knowing what you want your blog to say. When you first set up your blog, it might seem like a great idea to just post whatever is on your mind. But if you don’t really know what you want your blog to achieve, then it will likely fail. So start by planning out what your goals are and focus on hitting those goals rather than just posting anything without knowing why or how it will help you achieve those goals.

2. Not having a clear strategy for growth. One of the best ways to ensure that your blog does well is to have a solid strategy for growing it over time.
