How can you develop big ideas?
Developing big ideas is one of the most important skills you can have as a businessperson. It's easy to come up with good ideas, but it's even easier to turn them into successful businesses. Here are three tips to help you develop big ideas:
1. Make a list of all the possible solutions to your problem. This will give you a range of options to consider when coming up with potential solutions.

2. Break your problem down into smaller, more manageable chunks. This will make it easier to focus on solving each individual piece of the puzzle and creating a solution that meets your needs and goals.

3. Talk with other people about your idea.

Ideas for New Products: What new products are being created that could be appealing to people?
New products are being created all the time that could be appealing to people, such as new transportation options, wellness advancements, and more. It is hard to come up with a specific idea for a new product, but here are some possibilities: 1. A bike-sharing service that would allow people to use bikes to get around town instead of having to take public transportation. This could be especially helpful for those who live in complexes or have difficult access to public transportation. 2. A weight loss supplement that was made specifically for women and would help them lose weight and reduce their risk of heart disease. 3. An aromatherapy inhaler that could be used for general health benefits or for aromatherapy applications such as treating stress and anxiety.
