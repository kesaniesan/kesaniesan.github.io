The power of creativity
Creativity is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It is the ability to see things differently, to make connections that others don’t see, and to come up with new ideas and solutions.
Creativity is what allows us to solve problems, to invent new technologies, and to create works of art that move and inspire us. It is the engine of progress. And it is something that we all have within us.

So why is creativity so powerful? One reason is that it helps us to see the world in new ways. When we are faced with a problem, creative thinking allows us to find new solutions that we might not have otherwise considered.

Another reason is that creativity allows us to tap into our imagination and come up with ideas that are truly original.

The purpose of creativity: What does it achieve?
Creativity has been variously defined as the ability to think out of the box, come up with new ideas, or express yourself in a new way. In some cases creativity is simply a tool that can be used to achieve a desired outcome. However, there is another purpose for creativity – the art of creative expression. This type of creativity is often overlooked but can have a significant impact on people and businesses.
