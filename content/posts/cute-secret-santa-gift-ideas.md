The history of invention: from the ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers
Invention ideas have been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that they continue to be a part of our daily lives today. From ancient Egyptians to the Wright brothers, some inventions have had a lasting impact on society and the world. Here are five examples:
1) The wheel was invented by the ancient Egyptians, who used it to move goods around their cities.

2) The telescope was invented by Johannes Kepler in 1611, which allowed him to see things that were previously impossible to see.

3) The telephone was invented by Samuel Morse in 1876, which allowed people to communicate with one another without having to speak directly.

4) The computer was invented by Charles Babbage in 1871, which allowed people to create new ways of doing calculations.

The types of creative art
Creative art is a form of expression that is unique to the individual. There are many different types of creative art, each with its own purpose and meaning.
Some common types of creative art include painting, sculpture, photography, and music. Each type of art has its own way of conveying emotion and ideas. Painting, for example, can be used to express feelings or tell a story. Sculpture can be used to create a physical representation of an idea or feeling. Photography can capture a moment in time and Music can convey emotion and tell a story.

Creative art is important because it allows us to express ourselves in ways that words cannot always convey. It is a way to communicate our feelings and ideas to others. It can also be used as a form of therapy, as it can help us to process our emotions and release stress.
