Defining creativity
What is creativity? It‚Äôs a question that has been asked for centuries and one that still does not have a solid answer. The definition of creativity has eluded artists, scientists, philosophers, and thinkers for years. But why?
Part of the reason why it‚Äôs so difficult to define creativity is because it means different things to different people. For some, creativity is about coming up with new and innovative ideas. For others, it‚Äôs about expressing yourself in a unique and original way.

But despite the difficulty in defining it, there are some commonalities that all definitions of creativity share. Creativity is often seen as a process of turning something ordinary into something extraordinary. It‚Äôs about taking something that already exists and making it better or transforming it into something completely new.

Is creativity necessary for success?
Creativity is not always necessary for success, but it can certainly play a role. In some cases, creativity can be helpful in coming up with new ideas or strategies. However, in others, creativity may not be the best choice. For example, if you are looking to succeed as a business owner, then you need to be able to come up with innovative and effective plans. However, if you want to be creative and come up with new ideas on your own behalf, then it might not be the best choice.
