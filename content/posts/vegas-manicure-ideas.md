The Power of Big Ideas
The power of big ideas is at the root of most innovation. Ideas that are large enough to engage people and make a difference can touch every aspect of our lives. From the simplest things to the biggest challenges, big ideas can impact everything and everyone around them.
There are a number of ways to create big ideas, but some are easier than others. One approach is to come up with a concept that you’re passionate about and then explore what others have said about it. Another way is to read articles, watch videos, or listen to lectures on different topics in order to develop an idea for your business or product.

Whatever method you choose, remember that big ideas are worth pursuing – no matter how challenging or difficult they may seem at first.

Inspiration from Others: What sources can you draw from?
If you're looking to up your creative game, take inspiration from others. Whether it's learning new techniques or paying homage to classic pieces, there are endless possibilities out there. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
Start with old pieces of art. Draw inspiration from both the beauty and functionality of older pieces. Use them as models for your own designs. 

Create a mashup. What if your favorite song was turned into a visual masterpiece? What if each image in your collection was mashed together into one cohesive work? This is what getting on the beaten path is all about – finding orphaned works of art and turning them into something special. 

Inspire yourself with nature. Take a walk in nature and see how different elements impact how you see things.

Types of creativity: How do different types of creativity differ?
Creativity is a relative term. Some people may say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is the process of coming up with new ways to do something.
