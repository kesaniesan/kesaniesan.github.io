Impact of innovation: What are the implications of new technology on society and the economy?
Invention ideas are changing the way we live and work. They can bring new ways of doing things, products or services to market that improve our quality of life or create new economic opportunities. However, as innovation increases, so do the potential implications it has on society and the economy. One key question is how these changes will impact workers, businesses and the public sector. Another is how best to manage and accommodate those changes.
The United Kingdom recently announced a Â£149 million investment in innovation research and development (IRD). This brings IRD into line with other European countries that have also placed emphasis on innovation as a key part of their growth plans. The UK is seen as an example of how businesses and investors can benefit from early adoption of innovative technologies. It also shows that there is still a great deal of interest in this type of investment in Britain.
