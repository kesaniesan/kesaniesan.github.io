The Process of Inventing
Invention ideas can come from many sources. Sometimes people get invention ideas from everyday life experiences, while others get their ideas from solving problems they encounter in their work. Many times, people get invention ideas from observing how other people use products or how machines operate. The key to generating invention ideas is to be observant and to look for problems that need solving.
Once you have an idea for an invention, the next step is to figure out how it will work. This involves doing some research and experimentation to develop a prototype of your invention. Once you have a working prototype, you can then test it to see if it works as intended. If it does, you can then start marketing your invention and selling it to consumers.
