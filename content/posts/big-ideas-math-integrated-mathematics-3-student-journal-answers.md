The Future of Work: What needs to be done to keep people employed?
There is no doubt that the future of work is fraught with uncertainty. There are many reasons for this, but one big factor is the increasing use of technology. The way that technology affects work and jobs is changing constantly, so it's important to keep up with the latest trends. Some ideas that could help to keep people employed include: 
1) More job flexibility – as technology advances, it becomes easier and more affordable for people to change their working hours or locations whenever they feel like it. This means that there are more opportunities for people to work from home, which can be a great way to stay on top of your schedule and stay organized. 
2) Better communication between employers and employees – not everyone needs the same level of communication when it comes to working with their boss.

Types of ideas: What are some common types of ideas?
Ideas can be broadly classified into three groups: creative, problem-solving, and historical. creative ideas come from the mind and are original; problem-solving ideas come from solutions to problems or solutions to problems that have already been tried or found to be effective; and historical ideas come from recalling past experiences or events and imagining possible future scenarios.
