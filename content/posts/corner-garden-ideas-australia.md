What are big ideas? What are some of the most important things to remember when it comes to big ideas?
There are a few important things to remember when it comes to big ideas. The first is that ideas should be focused and specific. If they're not, they'll likely never see the light of day. Second, it's important to have a plan for execution. This will help ensure that your idea actually happens, and doesn't just languish in your head. Finally, you need some backing from others before you can start anything truly big. Without this support, it's more difficult to truly push an idea off the ground.

How can you get creative and come up with new ideas?
Creativity is key to any success. If you can come up with new ideas, you’ll be on your way to becoming a more successful person. It’s not hard to come up with new ideas when you think about it. Just keep your mind open and don’t be afraid to try something new. Here are three tips for getting creative:
1. Start with small tasks. When you have some creativity going for you, it’s easier to get started on bigger projects. Try coming up with a few different ideas for a project and see which ones sound best before jumping into the full-blown creation process.

2. Take time with your ideas. Once you have your brainstorming materials, it’s important to take some time to really think about what you want your idea to say or do.
