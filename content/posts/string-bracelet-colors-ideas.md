Problem-solving ideas involve taking several steps in order to find a solution to a problem. These include solving an equation for example, or figuring out how to make something work better. Inventive ideas involve coming up with new ways to do something, or finding an old way of doing something and adapting it to new circumstances.

Creativity is an important factor in any business. Whether itâ€™s a creative idea for a new product, or taking on a new challenge, creativity can help businesses succeed. Here are five different types of creativity that can help your business thrive: 
1. Idea generation: This type of creativity comes from having a creative thought and then coming up with an idea for a product or service. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that have never been created before, or products that are different from what is currently being sold. 
2. Innovation: This type of creativity comes from taking on a new challenge and seeing how you can improve upon what has been done before. It can be helpful to come up with ideas for products that are different in terms of design, structure, or function.
