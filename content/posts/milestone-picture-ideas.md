Ideas can be any thing that you want them to be, but they have to be ideas that you can think of. Usually, ideas come to you when you are in a hurry and don't have any time to think about them. Ideas can also come from your own thoughts or those of others. The best way to find out what ideas are around town is to take the initiative and start thinking about them yourself.
