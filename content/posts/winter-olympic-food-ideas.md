What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, but they can be hard to come by. Here are some tips on finding big ideas that will help you succeed: 
1. Define what you want your business to achieve. Once you have a clear idea of what your business wants to accomplish, it's easier to come up with ideas for how to achieve it. 
2. Think about who your target market is. Big businesses often think about their target market as all the people who are potential customers or employees who might be interested in their product or service. However, there are also many people out there who don't have a specific interest in your product or service, and you need to include them in your thinking while developing your big idea. 
3. Create a vision and mission statement.

What are some creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere, and it's hard to know where to start. Here are some ideas to get you started: 
-Start with what you know. What are some things that you enjoy doing or have a special interest in? Try thinking of ways to combine those hobbies with your creativity. 
-Explore new creative routes. Once you know some creative methods, start exploring different ways of doing things. What works for one artist might not work for another, but there is always room for growth. 
-Think outside the box. Sometimes all you need is an idea to get started on something new. Experiment until you find something that works and then copy it!
