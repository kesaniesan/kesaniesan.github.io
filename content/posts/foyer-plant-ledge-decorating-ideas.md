The challenges of invention: Describe some of the challenges faced by inventors.
Invention is often lauded as the key to progress. Indeed, many of the most important advances in human history have come about through invention. But what is often overlooked is the fact that invention can be a difficult and challenging process. Inventors must not only be creative, but they must also have the persistence and determination to see their ideas through to fruition.
The challenges of invention are many and varied. Inventors must first come up with an idea that is both novel and useful. They then need to find a way to turn that idea into a reality, which often requires a great deal of trial and error. Even after an invention is completed, there are still challenges to be faced, such as marketing the invention and ensuring that it meets all safety and regulatory requirements.
