Creativity in the arts: What makes art creative?
Creativity in the arts has been around for centuries, with different techniques and approaches used to achieve it. One of the key elements that makes art creative is the ability to see things differently and come up with new ideas. There are many different ways to be creative, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are five of the most common ways artists are able to be creative: 
1. Drawing: Drawing is often seen as a passive process, with artists only using pencils and paper to create drawings. However, drawing can also be interactive, with artists using their imagination to create new drawings.

2. Painting: Painting is often seen as an active process, where artists use paintbrushes, palette knives, and other tools to create paintings. Paintings can be large or small, and they can be filled with color or without any color at all.

The value of feedback: How important is it to get feedback on ideas before they are implemented?
Feedback is an important part of any business. It can help you make sure your ideas are a good fit for the company, and it can help you improve your products or services. But getting feedback on ideas before they're implemented can be just as important. If you don't get feedback, you could end up implementing something that's not really what you wanted or was hoping for. Feedback can also help you learn how to improve your business model and improve the way your products and services are delivered. It's worth getting it, whether it's through surveys or informal conversations with employees.
