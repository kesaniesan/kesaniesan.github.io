Types of innovation: Product, process, market, and technology
Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

Process Innovation: Processes can be innovative too. For example, Google's search engine was revolutionary because it used natural language processing to find relevant results quickly.

Market Innovation: The market can also be innovative if it is different from what other companies offer. Apple's iPhone was the first phone to sell in billion units worldwide.

The role of creativity in work: How does creativity impact productivity?
Creativity is a key factor in work. By definition, creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas and innovations. This can be seen in everything from creative writing to product development. In today's economy, creativity is becoming more and more important as businesses strive to stay competitive.
One way that creativity can help businesses is by providingid→products or services that are not possible with traditional methods. For example, an idea for a new product could come from a brainstorming session where everyone comes up with different concepts. Once the product is developed, it could be marketed using creative ideas like creating slogans or marketing videos that are unique and engaging.

Beyond just products and services, creativity also plays an important role in team productivity. When people have access to fresh and innovative ideas, they are able to come up with better solutions faster.
