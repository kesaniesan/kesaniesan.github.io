Definition of big ideas: What is it, and why should we care?
The definition of big ideas can vary greatly, but typically they refer to ideas that could have a significant impact on society or the world. Big ideas are usually long-term and require thought and effort to put into fruition, so they're important not just for businesses but also for government and social organizations. Here are five definitions of big ideas that may help make them more clear:
1) A big idea is an innovative solution or plan that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
2) A big idea is a new way of thinking about something that's been around for a while but hasn't been fully explored.
3) An idea with potential to create jobs, boost economy, or improve education is often called a big idea. 
4) Ideas with significant implications for individuals or groups are also considered big ideas.

How creativity can be used in your work.
Creativity is key in any workplace. Whether it’s creating new ideas for products or services, coming up with solutions to problems, or simply coming up with new ways of doing things, creativity is essential to a successful organization.
But what if creativity wasn’t just reserved for the creative minds of artists and creatives? What if it was used in every day tasks, too? How could creativity be used in your work if you want it to be effective?

One way to use creativity in your work is by using problem solving as a tool. By thinking outside the box and coming up with creative solutions to problems, you can help make your business more efficient and successful. And while using creativity in your everyday life may not sound as glamorous as being an artist or creative thinker, it can have major benefits at work.
