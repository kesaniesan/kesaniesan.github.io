When it comes to ideas, no one is an expert. Everyone has different ideas and opinions on what should be done, which is why it's important to have a general idea of what you're looking for when coming up with ideas. Here are some key tips to help you get started:
1. Consider the audience: What will the idea be effective for? Is it for a small group of people, or a large one? What are their needs and wants?

2. Think about potential solutions: Once you've determined who or what your target audience is, consider what problems could be solved by using the given idea.

Types of creativity: Intuitive, logical, creative, and gestural
Creativity is a highly subjective term that can be defined in many ways. Some might say that creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, while others might say that creativity is simply making something new. Whatever definition one chooses, there are some key elements to creative thinking which are all based on intuition. Intuitive thinking often comes from the subconscious and is not based on logical thought processes. This makes it much more difficult to control, but can also be very effective in solving problems or creating solutions.
