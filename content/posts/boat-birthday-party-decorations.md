The history of brainstorming
In the late 1940s, a group of psychologists working at Yale University began to study what is now known as brainstorming. The team, led by George Prince, was interested in finding out whether people could come up with more ideas if they worked on their own or in groups.
The psychologists conducted a series of experiments in which participants were asked to come up with as many ideas as possible for different topics. They found that people who worked on their own came up with fewer ideas than those who worked in groups.

The psychologists also found that the quality of the ideas generated was better when people worked in groups. This is because people are able to build on each other's ideas and come up with new and better ideas as a result.

The findings of the Yale study sparked a lot of interest in the idea of brainstorming and its potential benefits.
