The definition of creativity
Creativity is an intangible quality that many people seek to define. However, any definition of creativity must have at least one key component - the inspiration and motivation to produce something new. In today's society, creativity is often praised for its ability to inspire change, but it can also be used to create things that are commercially successful. The definition of creativity will change over time as more and more evidence is brought to light that creative art has a number of benefits beyond simply making people happy.

The Benefits of a Blog
If you're looking for ways to improve your blog and make more money, then a blog is a great place to start. Not only can you share your thoughts and experiences with your audience, but you can also sell your content through advertising or affiliate programs. Here are some of the benefits of having a blog: 
1) You can build brand awareness: When people see your name and know who you are, they're more likely to visit your website or read your posts. This will help increase traffic and revenue, which will in turn help you pay bills, buy items online, or pay off debt. 
2) You can build relationships with readers: When you have an active blog community and engage with readers on a regular basis, you'll create a valuable connection that'll last longer.
