Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.
