What are big ideas?
When it comes to big ideas, there are a few things that you can always count on. With the right mindset, any big idea can be turned into a successful business venture. So what are some of the most common big ideas? Here are five of the most common:
1. Start with something small. When you have a big goal in mind, it’s easier to focus on smaller steps that will make your dream a reality. This is especially true for businesses – by starting with something small, you can gradually increase your chances of achieving your larger goal.

2. Be persistent. If you want to achieve success, don’t give up until the end. Pounds saved every month will eventually lead to more money in your pocket and more customers coming through your door.

History of Invention: From prehistoric times to the present day
Invention has been a part of human history for as long as humans have been able to think and do things. From prehistoric times, there was evidence of people trying to come up with new ideas and inventions. Inventions have helped us achieve many things, from making everyday items more efficient and easier to creating new technologies that have made life more difficult for enemies or even our own countries. Throughout the years, different people have tried to come up with new ideas and inventions, but no one has been able to completely invent everything. Some inventions are just better than others, while others may not have had a very wide impact. But overall, invention has always been a key part of human history.
