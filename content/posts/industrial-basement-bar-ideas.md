Creative people are often seen as 'idiots' or 'noobs', but that's not always true. In fact, many creative people can achieve amazing things if they set their mind to it.

Definition of big idea: A creative or innovative idea that has the potential to change the way people live, work, and play.
Big ideas are those that have the potential to change the way we live, work, and play. There are many big ideas out there, but it can be tough to find the right one to bring about big results. Sometimes, just having an idea can help you achieve a much-needed goal. Here are five big ideas that could change the way you live and work: 
1. A “big data” platform that collects and analyzes vast amounts of data in order to provide insights for businesses and consumers. This would allow businesses to make better decisions faster, while consumers could gain access to information they wouldn’t otherwise have access to.

2. A new payment method that allows anyone with an internet connection and a phone or tablet device to easily pay for goods and services using their phones or tablets.

What is customer service and how do you provide it?
Customer service is a term that is often used interchangeably with customer relations. It refers to the various methods through which customers can interact with companies and receive the service they need. From calling in for a repair to speaking with a supervisor, there are many ways to get help from your company.
There are two main types of customer service: face-to-face and online. Face-to-face customer service allows customers to interact with employees directly. Online customer service is more common, but it can also be accessed from computers or devices. This type of customer service provides a variety of options for customers, including webinars, chat rooms, and social media platforms.

Both types of customer service have their own strengths and weaknesses.
