Introduce the topic of invention.
Invention is the driving force behind progress. It has led to the creation of technologies that have made our lives easier and more enjoyable. It is a process that involves the generation of new ideas, the development of those ideas into a plan or prototype, and the testing and refinement of the prototype. Inventors are people who are able to see beyond the status quo and imagine something better. They are creative problem-solvers who are always looking for ways to improve upon existing products or create entirely new ones. The invention process can be long and arduous, but the rewards can be great. Those who are successful in inventing something that makes a difference in the world can achieve fame and fortune.
