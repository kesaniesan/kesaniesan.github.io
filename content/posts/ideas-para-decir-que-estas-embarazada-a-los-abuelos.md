What are big ideas?
Big ideas are important, and they can help spur new thought and innovation. Here are some of the most common big ideas:
1. We can all be more creative. big ideas can come from anywhere, but creativity is often found in the imagination. The more we can tap into our creativity, the better we'll be able to think of new ways to improve things.

2. There's no one right way to do something. Just because something seems impossible or impossible-minded, that doesn't mean it isn't possible or reasonable to try out for a change. A big idea is just a suggestion - so try out different ideas until you find the one that works best for you and your situation.

3. Disruptive innovation is key to success in any industry.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for business?
Creativity is key to businesses. Without creativity, businesses couldn't exist. However, what does it mean for business? 
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. This can be done through brainstorming, creative thinking, or simply coming up with different options and concepts. 

However, creativity also has to be used wisely. Too much creativity can lead to a lack of focus and productivity in a business. And too little creativity can also lead to boredom or stagnation. 

So while creativity is key to businesses, it's also important that businesses use it in a responsible manner. Otherwise, they could get left behind in the competitive race for innovation.

How Invention began
Invention is a process of creating something new and often involving the use of an unknown or unusual tool. Many inventions have originated from the simplest concepts, such as a design for a shirt that was first conceived by a tailor. Other inventions, like the transistor, were created through years of trial and error before they were finally realized in devices such as radios and TVs. Inventions can be so important to our society that they are often consideredtreasures, and some have even been donated to universities or used in scientific research.
