Creativity is a process by which a symbolic representation of one's ideas is generated. Many people believe that creativity is simply the result of good ideas, but it is much more than that. It is the ability to see the world in new ways, to find hidden patterns, and to make connections between seemingly disparate objects or ideas.

A few examples of creative work
Creative ideas are nothing new to us, but they can be found in a variety of forms. Sometimes they come from simple things, like when someone comes up with a new way to do something, or when someone comes up with an innovative solution to a problem. Other times, creative ideas come from more complex solutions that require some extra thought and effort. But no matter what the form, creativity is always welcome and appreciated.

The process of innovation
Innovation is the process of introducing something new into the market. This can be a new product, a new service, or a new way of doing things. Innovation is often driven by necessity, as companies look for ways to improve their products and services to meet the needs of their customers.
Innovation starts with an idea. This can come from anywhere â€“ from within the company, from customers, or from outside sources. Once an idea has been identified, it must be developed and tested to see if it is feasible and will meet the needs of the target market. If it is successful, it will be launched into the market and become available to consumers.

Innovation is not easy, and it often takes many tries before a successful product or service is developed.
