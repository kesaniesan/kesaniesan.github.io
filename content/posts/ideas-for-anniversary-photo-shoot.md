The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

Conclusion: What are the benefits of developing big ideas?
Big ideas are the foundation of great businesses and civilizations. They're a way to think outside the box and come up with new solutions to old problems. With the right tools, big ideas can become realities. Here's how to develop big ideas for your business or organization:
1. Start by thinking about what you want your business or organization to achieve. What are your goals? What do you need to change in order to reach those goals? How will your customers feel if you don't deliver on those goals? What are some potential solutions to problems that you could address?

2. Next, think about who your target audience is. Who should be driving your business or organization forward? Do you want to reach a specific group of people, or do you want everyone who matters in your industry to be able to benefit from what you have to offer?
