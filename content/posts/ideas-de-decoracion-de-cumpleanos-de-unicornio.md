Idea #3:
Ideas are the bedrock of any successful enterprise. Whether you're starting a business, developing a new product, or simply trying to solve a problem, having a great idea is the first step.
But what makes a great idea? And how can you come up with one? Here are three key tips:

1. Look for problems to solve. A great idea usually comes from solving a problem. So if you're looking for an idea, start by identifying problems that need solving. This could be something as simple as making your daily commute more efficient, or it could be something more complex like developing a new treatment for cancer.

2. Brainstorm with others. Sometimes the best ideas come from collaboration. If you're stuck, try brainstorming with friends, family, or colleagues.

What is brainstroming?
What is brainstroming? Brainstroming is a term used to describe the phenomenon of sudden changes in thought or activity that are unrelated to one's original focus. Brainstroming can be caused by various factors such as stress, fatigue, or a change in situation. It can also be caused by an increase in activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for control and decision-making.
