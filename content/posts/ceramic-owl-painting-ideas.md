Section 4: How to overcome creative blocks.
Nearly everyone experiences creative blocks at some point in their lives. For some people, it happens frequently; for others, more rarely. But whether you’re a professional artist or someone who just likes to dabble in creativity from time to time, it can be frustrating when you suddenly find yourself unable to come up with new ideas.
There are a number of ways you can overcome creative blocks. One is to simply take a break from whatever project you’re working on and come back to it later with fresh eyes. Sometimes all it takes is a little distance to see things in a new light and come up with the solutions you couldn’t see before.

Another way to overcome creative blocks is to brainstorm with someone else. Collaborating with someone can help spark new ideas and give you perspective on problems you’re having trouble solving on your own.

Impact of innovation: What are the implications of new technology on society and the economy?
Invention ideas are changing the way we live and work. They can bring new ways of doing things, products or services to market that improve our quality of life or create new economic opportunities. However, as innovation increases, so do the potential implications it has on society and the economy. One key question is how these changes will impact workers, businesses and the public sector. Another is how best to manage and accommodate those changes.
The United Kingdom recently announced a £149 million investment in innovation research and development (IRD). This brings IRD into line with other European countries that have also placed emphasis on innovation as a key part of their growth plans. The UK is seen as an example of how businesses and investors can benefit from early adoption of innovative technologies. It also shows that there is still a great deal of interest in this type of investment in Britain.
