How to develop them: Be creative
Invention ideas don't just come to people in a sudden eureka moment; usually, it's the result of a process of development. If you want to learn how to develop your own invention ideas, there are a few things you can do. 
First, take some time to brainstorm and think about the problems you encounter in your daily life. What would make your life easier? What does not work well or efficiently? Once you have identified some potential areas for improvement, do some research to see if anyone else has had the same idea. 

Next, start thinking about possible solutions to the problem. How could it be fixed? What would be the best way to achieve this? Try to come up with several different ideas, and then evaluate each one. Which one is most feasible? Which one would be the most effective?

Examples of creativity: Music, art, fashion, cooking, gardening, writing
Creativity is everywhere. Whether it’s in the creative minds behind design, the creativity that goes into making music or art, or simply how people approach their every day tasks, creativity is always at work. However, what we often don’t consider is how creativity manifests itself in our everyday lives. For example, when you go to a restaurant and see all of the different items on the menu, do you think about the creativity that went into designing and coming up with a plan for each dish? Or when you walk through your neighborhood and see all of the different houses, are you thinking about how much creativity went into picking out the right one for your home? In both cases, there was a lot of thought put into it. And just as importantly, both examples have had an impact on people who have tasted them.

Early Inventors and Inventions
Invention is a process of putting new ideas or objects into use. Inventions are often born out of necessity, as people try to solve everyday problems. But some inventions are created simply for the sake of novelty or fun. Early inventors made many important contributions to society, developing useful technologies that we still use today.
Some of the earliest known inventors include the Ancient Greek engineer Hero of Alexandria, who created the first steam engine, and Ctesibius, who invented the first water pump. In China, inventors developed paper and gunpowder in the 9th century. These inventions would have a profound impact on the world.

The Industrial Revolution saw a wave of new inventions that changed the way we live and work. Among these were the spinning jenny, which revolutionized textile production, and the steam engine, which powered factories and transportation.
