There are several ways to do this, and the most important part is to find the right method for you and your business. Inventors should also be careful when patenting their ideas as they could face infringement lawsuits if someone else uses them without giving credit or sharing in profits.

How to come up with big ideas
There’s no one answer to the question of how to come up with big ideas. But by understanding the process that goes into creating big ideas, you can better appreciate and embrace those that come your way. Here are a few tips:
1. Start with a question: What do you want to achieve?
2. Get organized: This is where things get interesting. By coming up with a specific goal, you can start to imagine all the possible ways your solution could work and which aspects of your business could benefit from it. This will help you narrow down your options and coalesce them into a more reasonable, manageable project.
3. Break it down: Once you have identified what you want, break it down into smaller goals or areas of focus that are easier to manage and achieve.

Inventors and their inventions
Inventors are people who create something new that has never been seen before. They come up with an idea, and then turn that idea into a reality. Inventions can be anything from a simple tool to a life-saving medical device.
Some of the most famous inventors in history are Leonardo da Vinci, Thomas Edison, and the Wright brothers. Da Vinci was an artist and scientist who invented many things, including the helicopter and the tank. Edison is known for inventing the light bulb and the phonograph. The Wright brothers invented the airplane.

Inventors make our world a better place. They help us solve problems and make everyday tasks easier. We owe a lot to these creative thinkers!
