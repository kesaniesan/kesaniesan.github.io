The Problem/Solution: How do you come up with an idea?
There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the question of how to come up with an idea, but following a few simple steps can help. First, identify what you want to create. This can be anything from a new product to a new way of doing something. Next, think about what others may have done or seen that would inspire you. If you have this kind of inspiration, you can begin working on your idea by imagining what people might be able to do with your product or service. Finally, come up with ways to make your idea even better. By doing this, you will not only increase the chances that your product or service will be successful, but also give yourself the opportunity to improve on any mistakes that may have been made in the early stages of development.

The Process of Being Creative
When it comes to creative ideas, the process can be a bit mysterious. Where do they come from? How can you get more of them? While there's no one answer to these questions, there are some things you can do to increase your chances of having a great idea.
First, make sure you're exposing yourself to new things. Ideas often come from seeing something in a new way or combining two disparate things. If you're stuck in the same old routine, it'll be harder to have those "a-ha!" moments.

 Second, give yourself time and space to daydream. Once you have an idea, it's important to let it percolate for a while before taking action on it. Often, the best ideas come when you're not actively trying to think of one.

Finally, don't be afraid to experiment and take risks.
