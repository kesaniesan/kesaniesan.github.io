What makes big ideas great?
Big ideas are a critical part of any business or organization. They help to spark new thought, improve efficiency, and create value for shareholders. But what makes big ideas great? There are a few key factors that can make an idea stand out from the rest.
Some big ideas come from people who have strong convictions and see the world in a different way than most. Others come from people who are passionate about their topic and have an uncommon view of the world. Still others are generated by a brainstorming session or a large group of individuals who share an Idea that someone else has put forward.

Whatever the source, when an idea is great, it has something special going for it that sets it apart from other options. This is why ideas are so important – they give businesses and organizations the opportunity to explore new possibilities and find new ways to improve their operations or products.

How to write good content
Contentwriting isn't a one-time event. It's an ongoing, ongoing process that you can use to improve the quality of your website and increase viewership for your content. Below are some tips on how to write good content and increase viewership for your website or blog: 
1) Start with a strong opener. Your opening sentence should introduce the reader to your topic and help them understand what you're about. 

2) Use verbs correctly. Each verb needs a specific action to complete the sentence, so make sure all verbs are used correctly in your opening paragraph. For example, "I eat," "I play," "I watch." 

3) Use clear language. Your language should be easy to understand and use on a daily basis. Avoid overusing words or adjectives in your writing; they'll sound automated instead of interesting or engaging.
