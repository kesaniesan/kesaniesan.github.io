How does creativity impact our lives: What impacts creativity in our day-to-day lives?
Creativity is an important part of our day-to-day lives. Whether it’s coming up with new ideas for a project or simply enjoying new perspectives, creativity impacts how we see the world and how we interact with others. Creative people are often seen as more innovative and resourceful than their less creative counterparts. In fact, according to a study by The Economist, the average creative person in the United Kingdom earns over £50,000 more than the average non-creative person. This implies that creativity does have a significant impact on our lives in ways that are beyond just creating new things.
