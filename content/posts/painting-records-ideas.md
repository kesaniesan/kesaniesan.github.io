The History of Innovation:
Innovation is the process of expanding the boundaries of what is possible. Innovation occurs when a new idea or approach to solving a problem is proposed, and then tested and implemented. There are many different types of innovation, but some common ones include:
1. Research and development – This refers to the development of new products or services that are Pirandello-like in their concept but with real world application possibilities. It can be done through trials and prototypes, as well as product launches.

2. Creative destruction – This refers to the process by which ideas, concepts, or technologies that have been tried and failed before are resurrected and given a second chance. They may be used in combination, or they may be abandoned altogether after experiencing negative results.

Conclusion: What is creativity? What differentiates it from other abilities and how can it be used to create successful outcomes?
Creativity is the ability to come up with new ideas, formulations and plans that are not always easy to come by.

It can be used for good or bad outcomes, but creativity has a key advantage; it allows individuals to take risks and think outside the box.
