Types of innovation: Product, process, market, and technology
Innovation is a key topic in business. A product, process, market, and technology that are innovative can help a company achieve success. There are many types of innovation, and each one has its own strengths and weaknesses. Here are three examples: 
Product Innovation: A product that is new and different can help a company succeed. For example, Nike's "Champion" sneakers were revolutionary because they were the first shoes to use air pressure to keep the foot elevated during exercise.

Process Innovation: Processes can be innovative too. For example, Google's search engine was revolutionary because it used natural language processing to find relevant results quickly.

Market Innovation: The market can also be innovative if it is different from what other companies offer. Apple's iPhone was the first phone to sell in billion units worldwide.
