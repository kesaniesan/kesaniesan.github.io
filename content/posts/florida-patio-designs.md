Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.
