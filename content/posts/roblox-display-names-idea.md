The different types of creativity: Imagination, Invention, Create, and Expression.
Creativity is an important factor in any business or creative endeavor. It can come in the form of ideas, creativity, and expression. Creative individuals can be found in all walks of life, but there are key differences between creativity and invention.

Ideas: What makes a good idea?
Ideas are important, but they can also be a bit misguided. Sometimes, an idea is great, but it's not something that will actually work. Other times, an idea is great and something that will actually help people, but it might not be the right thing to do. Ultimately, ideas are important, but they need to be judged on their merits.
