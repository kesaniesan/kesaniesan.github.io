The definition of creativity
What is creativity? Many people have different definitions for creativity. Some say that it is when you come up with new and original ideas, while others define it as the ability to think outside the box and come up with solutions to problems.
Creativity can be defined as the ability to generate new and innovative ideas. It is often seen as a process of problem solving, where you take existing knowledge and use it in new and unique ways. Creativity is often associated with artistry and design, but it can also be found in other areas such as business, science, and technology.

There are many ways to encourage creativity. One way is to provide opportunities for people to work on creative projects together. This can help them to come up with new ideas and solutions by bouncing ideas off of each other.

The process of innovation
Innovation is a process that can be divided into four distinct stages: ideation, development, implementation, and diffusion.
Ideation is the stage in which new ideas are generated. This can involve brainstorming sessions, market research, or simply observing the world around you. Once an idea has been generated, it must be developed. This stage includes testing the feasibility of the idea and refining it until it is ready to be implemented.

Implementation is when the innovative idea is put into practice. This stage can be challenging, as it requires bringing the idea to life and making it work within the context of your business or organisation. Diffusion is the final stage of innovation, and refers to how widely the new idea is adopted. This stage is often influenced by factors such as marketing and word-of-mouth.

What are big ideas?
Big ideas are the seeds of new, innovative thinking that can change the way we live and work. They can be something as small as a new product or service or as large as a new way of looking at the world. There are endless possibilities when it comes to big ideas, and there is no one right way to come up with them. Here are five tips to help you get started: 
1. Be open to new ideas. Don’t be afraid to let your brain explore new possibilities. When you’re starting out, it might be helpful to focus on just a few big ideas and see how they play out in your head. This will give you a good foundation for what else you might want to think about. 
2. Be creative.

1st idea:
Ideas are the lifeblood of any business. Without fresh ideas, businesses would quickly become stagnant and fail to thrive. Though generating new ideas can be challenging, it is essential for businesses to keep the flow of ideas going in order to stay relevant and succeed.
There are a few ways to generate new ideas. One way is to hold brainstorming sessions with employees. This gets everyone in the company thinking about new possibilities and can often lead to some great concepts. Another way to come up with new ideas is to look at what other businesses in your industry are doing and try to improve upon it. Finally, don’t be afraid to think outside the box – sometimes the best ideas come from left field.

If you want your business to stay ahead of the competition, it is imperative that you generate new ideas on a regular basis.
