The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.

How can this new idea be implemented?
There is a new idea that could be implemented in the healthcare industry that is called electronic health records (EHRs). EHRs are a type of online system where patients can keep track of their health information and see updated information about their care. This would free up doctorâ€™s time to focus on more important tasks, such as patient examination and treatment. Additionally, it would make it easier for nurses to communicate with doctors, since they would have access to all the information the patient has on their record.

The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in peopleâ€™s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.

How to come up with big ideas: What are some steps you can take to hatch a great idea?
When you have an idea for a new product or service, it's important to take some steps to turn it into a reality. One of the most important steps is coming up with big ideas. Here are some tips on how to come up with great ideas: 1) brainstorming: Brainstorming can help you come up with concepts and ideas that are different from what you've ever thought of before. It can also help you see how others have approached similar problems or challenges. 2) exploring: exploration helps you see potential solutions and factors that could make your idea more successful. 3) crunching numbers: Crunching numbers can help you understand how your idea could be realized and sold. 4) taking the plunge: If your idea is too good to be true, make sure to study the market and find out if there is a demand for it before feasibility testing begins.
