Invention has been around for centuries, with some of the earliest examples dating back to ancient Greece. Inventions that have shaped the modern world include the telephone, car, and air conditioning – all of which were created in the 19th century. However, some inventions are much older than that and predate even humanity. For example, the wheel was first invented by a man named Pangloss in 4500 BC.
