The Different Types of Ideas: What are they and what do they mean for business?
Ideas can be defined in a few ways. The most popular definition is "A mental or creative concept that has the potential to make something happen." Ideas are something businesses need in order to think of new ways to approach their problems and come up with new solutions. 
There are many different types of ideas, but some of the more common ones include: 
- Product: This is the idea of what a product is and how it works. It could be anything from a product you buy at the store to a company's entire line of products. 
- Service: This is the idea of what a service is and how it works. It could be anything from providing customer support to doing your own research for an assignment. 
- Territory: This is the idea of who owns or controls a certain area of space or time.
