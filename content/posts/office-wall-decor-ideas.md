Why should someone take a big idea and turn it into a reality?
There are a few reasons why an idea can become something real. Maybe it's because it has the potential to solve a problem people have been dealing with for years, or maybe it's got the potential to change the way people live their lives. Whatever the reason, turning an idea into reality is something that can be difficult but definitely worth doing. Here are three tips on how to make your big idea a reality: 1) think long and hard about what you want your business to achieve, 2) do your research before starting your business, and 3) stay focused on what you want your business to be and not on what others are expecting it to be.

The history of innovation
Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired. Another period during the 20th century saw an increase in innovation but also a number of failures and setbacks. In the 21st century, there is an increasing focus on innovation as businesses and individuals are looking to find new ways to improve their products, services, and economies.

Discussion: Are any of the new ideas feasible or even desirable?
Do any of the new ideas proposed in a new white paper by Google and The New York Times hold promise for improving American society? If so, why are they being considered so cautiously?
Critics say that some of the proposals - such as creating a government-sponsored healthcare system - would be too costly or even unrealistic. Others worry that none of the new ideas will work.

But if a few potential solutions can be put into practice, they may well constitute a more effective way to improve the quality of life for Americans. So far, there is no clear evidence that any of these proposals have actually changed people's lives in meaningful ways.

Overcoming blocks: what to do when you can't think of anything
When you sit down to write and nothing comes to mind, it can be frustrating. But don't worry, there are things you can do to overcome this block.
First, try to relax. Take a deep breath and remind yourself that it's okay if you can't think of anything right now. It happens to everyone. Just take a break for a few minutes and come back later.

If relaxation doesn't work, try brainstorming. Write down any ideas that come to mind, no matter how silly they may seem. Once you have a list of ideas, you can start narrowing them down and developing them further.

If all else fails, talk to someone else about your project. Sometimes it helps to hear someone else's perspective on what you're trying to write about. They might have some good ideas that you can use.
