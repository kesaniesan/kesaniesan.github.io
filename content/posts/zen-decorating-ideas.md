Invention Displays: How can you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of protecting your invention from others who may want to make use of it. There are several ways to do this, but one of the most common is through filing a patent application. Patent applications can take many months to complete, so it’s important to be prepared for the wait. There are also several requirements that must be met in order to file a patent application, including having an idea for an invention and being able to prove that your idea is original. If you have any trouble filing a patent application or if it takes longer than expected, don’t worry – there are plenty of resources available to help you out.

How innovation effects businesses: It can lead to new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful.
Innovation has been a key driver of business success for centuries. For most businesses, innovation is about creating new products, services, or processes that make a company more competitive and successful. However, innovation can also lead to changes in how a company does its work that can have significant impacts on its competitive position and overall performance.
For example, imagine you are a business that sells products made from natural materials. As the world becomes increasingly polluted and health hazards increase, your products may not be enough to meet the needs of your customers. To stay competitive, you may need to find new ways to produce and sell your products using more sustainable materials.

Similarly, when it comes to research and development (R&D), businesses often face stiff competition from rivals who are better equipped to conduct innovative research and develop new products quickly.
