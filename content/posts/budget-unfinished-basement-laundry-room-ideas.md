The Challenges of Big Ideas: What can be done to overcome them?
The challenge of big ideas is that they can be revolutionary, but also risky and time-consuming to achieve. Some things that can help overcome this challenge include developing a process for vetting and approval of ideas, as well as having a clear goal for the idea, both during its early stages and once it has been developed. Additionally, having a team of experts who can help with the development and implementation of an idea can make it easier to get the message out there and grow awareness around it.

What makes a big idea: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change
When it comes to big ideas, there are three key elements that make them truly great: originality, simplicity, and the ability to provoke change. Without these essential ingredients, an idea is simply not going to have the impact or staying power that it needs to be truly successful.
 Originality is key because it allows an idea to stand out from everything else that’s already out there. If an idea is too similar to something else, it’s not going to make much of a splash. But if it’s completely new and different, people will take notice and want to learn more about it.

Simplicity is also important because it makes an idea easy to understand and remember. If an idea is too complex, people will quickly lose interest and move on to something else.
