The 4 Types of Ideas: What are the different types of ideas?
Ideas are what make our world go round. They can help us achieve our goals, change the course of history, or even save the lives of others. But what makes an idea unique? What make them different from other ideas?
There are four types of ideas: big ideas, innovative ideas, refreshed and fresh ideas, and breakthrough ideas.

Big Ideas: A big idea is something that is very new and different. It can be a way to solve a problem that people have been trying to figure out for years or it can be a solution to an old problem. A big idea can be anything from a new product to a new way of looking at life.

Innovation Ideas: An innovation idea is an idea that is new and different but still based on older principles or methods. Innovation ideas can range from simple solutions to complex problems.
