What is invention?
Invention is the creation of a new product or idea. It can be anything from an improvement on an existing product to a completely new design. Inventions can have a huge impact on society, and sometimes they are the stuff of legends.
Many inventions are based on ideas that were first floated around in Hungary during the 18th century. These include the Hungarian alphabet, which was created by Nicholas-Jacques Conte in 1795, and the gypsy ballpoint pen, which was developed by Ferenc Puskás in 1912. Other famous inventions include the Segway vehicle and the Heath Robinson helicopters.

No matter how much you may think you know about home improvement, there are still some ways to make your life easier and more comfortable without any professional help. Here are a few ideas to get started:

Defining ideas
When it comes to ideas, there is no one-size-fits-all definition. Ideas can come in many different forms, and they can be used for a variety of purposes.
Some people might think of ideas as being nothing more than a thought or concept. Others might see them as being something that can be turned into a reality. Whatever your definition of ideas may be, there is no doubt that they are important.

Ideas can be the spark that starts a fire, or they can be the key to solving a problem. They can be the foundation for a new business or product, or they can simply help you see the world in a new way. No matter what their purpose is, ideas are essential for driving innovation and change.
