The computer: How it was invented and how it has changed
In 1876, American inventors Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith created the first mechanical computers. These early machines were complex and expensive, and they could only be used by trained mathematicians and engineers. In 1937, British mathematician Alan Turing published a paper that described how a machine could be built to perform any type of calculation. Turing's paper inspired many scientists and engineers to begin work on electronic computers. In 1941, German engineer Konrad Zuse designed and built the first programmable computer. The first computers were large, expensive, and used vacuum tubes for circuitry.

How to Choose the Right Tools for Your DIY Projects:
There are a number of factors you need to consider when choosing the right tools for your DIY projects. Here are four tips to help you make the best decision:
1. What you need: You should have a basic understanding of how tools work before beginning any project. If you don't know what you're using, it's hard to be successful. choose the right tool for the job and don't overspend on something you can't use or don't need.

2. The size of the project: smaller tasks may require smaller tools, while bigger projects may require larger tools. Make sure to get a tool that is appropriate for your needs and your skill level.

3. The type of project: Some projects are better suited for one-time use, while others may require more expertise or experience than what is available at home.

Conclusion: What are the benefits and challenges of big ideas?
Big ideas are a time-tested way to solve unique problems. They're also a challenge to create because they often require a new perspective and an innovative approach to what's already been tried. While big ideas can have significant benefits, there are also risks associated with them, which can influence their success or failure. Here are three key Takeaways from the past several years of big idea development: 
1. Big ideas can be successful if they're based on sound principles and backed up by research.
2. The risks associated with big ideas can impact their success or failure, and those risks need to be considered when developing them.
3. A big idea needs to be well thought out and supported by others in order for it to become reality.
