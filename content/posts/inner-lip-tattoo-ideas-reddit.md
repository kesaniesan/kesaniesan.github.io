There are a few things that you can do in order to solve a problem. One of the most common techniques is brainstorming, which is when you come up with ideas for solving a problem without actually knowing how to fix it. Brainstroming is another way of solving problems, and it involves taking some specific ideas and turning them into a plan. This way, you can start thinking about ways to make your plan work and then take action towards achieving your goals.
