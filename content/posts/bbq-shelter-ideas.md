Types of creativity: Intuition, inspiration, and reason.
Creativity is a spectrum. From the simple to the complex, there are many different ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition, inspiration, and reason are three of the most common ways that creativity can be expressed. Intuition is when you don’t have any specific information about how something should look or feel, and inspiration comes from your own ideas or memories. Reason comes from knowing why something exists and what it has done for other people or things in the past. These three forms of creativity can all be used interchangeably, but they each have their own strengths and weaknesses. Intuition is often used to create new ideas, while inspiration helps you see what has already been done and why it was successful. Reason is often used to find solutions to problems, while intuition can be used for more creative thinking outside of the box.

The process: How do you go about brainstorming ideas?
brainstorming ideas can be a fun and quick way to come up with new ideas, but there are a few things you need to keep in mind in order to create the best brainstorming experience. First, make sure that you have some idea of what you want your brainstorming session to be about. If you don't know what you want your meeting to become, it's probably not going to be as productive. Additionally, it's important that everyone is on the same page when it comes time for the brainstorming process. If one person starts talking and then somebody else joins in, it's difficult to continue getting productive ideas out of the group. Finally, make sure that everyone has their own space in which they can work without feeling crowded or interrupted.
