Definition of a big idea: What are the consequences of considering something?
Big ideas are a common feature of any innovation, whether it’s in the business world or scientific research. They can be defined in many ways, but here are a few key points:
1. A big idea is an innovative solution to a problem that has yet to be solved.

2. It must have significant implications for the world as a whole, and its potential solutions must be fully realized before it can be considered a "big idea."

3. There is typically no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to developing a big idea, but some commonly used criteria include: novelty, impact/impactiveness, feasibility, and opportunity/opportunity cost.

There are many ideas in 2022 that could have a huge impact on society and economies. One idea is to institute a universal basic income, which would give all citizens a fixed amount of money without any strings attached. Another idea is to legalize marijuana, which would help to reduce the amount of crime and underage drinking. Finally, another idea is to increase the number of hours worked per week, which would lead to more saved money and less need for job security.
