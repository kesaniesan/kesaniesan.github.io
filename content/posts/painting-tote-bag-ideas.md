Historical Background of Invention: From ancient Greece to the American Revolution.
Invention is the act of bringing a new product to the market, or making a change in an old product so that it can be successful. It is often credited to individuals, gangs, and governments who come up with new ideas for fixing things or improving society. Invention has been a part of human history for as long as people have been able to think about it. The ancient Greeks were the first to develop inventive minds and come up with new products. They invented everything from farming tools to missiles. Inventions played an important role in the development of civilizations and the rise of republics. The American Revolution was also led by inventors, including Benjamin Franklin and John Adams.

The power of creativity: What does it mean for artists?
Creativity is a key word when it comes to artists. It can mean different things to different people, but in general, creativity refers to the ability of an individual to come up with new and innovative ideas. This doesn’t just mean coming up with new ways to look at an old problem or coming up with new solutions to old problems; creativity can also be used to come up with new ways of looking at things. For example, if you were a painter and you wanted to create a painting that depicted the history of art, you might come up with something that showed how various Artists have used their creativity in order to create their work. In fact, some artists even go so far as to say that creativity is the only thing that separates them from other professional artists.
