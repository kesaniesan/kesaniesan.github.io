Definition of Innovation: Ideas that improve the quality, efficiency, or effectiveness of life
Innovation is the process of developing a new product, service, or idea that improves quality, efficiency, or effectiveness. Innovation ideas can be specific to a certain industry or field, but they also have the potential to be applied to any area of life. 
One example of an innovation that has been implemented successfully in many industries is the automobile. The development and implementation of efficient and effective car engines has led to increased speeds and efficiency on the road. Another example is the internet. The early days were difficult for website designers because no one had a clear definition of what “web design” meant. However, as technology evolved and more people became comfortable using computers, websites started popping up all over the place. As a result, web design has become one of the most popular areas for innovation today.

Overcoming roadblocks: how to keep the ideas flowing
Brainstorming is a great way to overcome roadblocks and keep the ideas flowing. However, it can be difficult to come up with new ideas if you feel like you've hit a wall. Here are a few tips to help you get the most out of your brainstorming sessions:
1. Set some ground rules. Before you start brainstorming, agree on a few ground rules with your team. For example, you might want to agree that everyone will have a turn to share their ideas, and that no one will judge or criticize any ideas.

2. Get creative with prompts. If you're struggling to come up with new ideas, try using prompts to jump-start your creativity. You can either use prompts that are related to the task at hand, or completely unrelated topics that will get your brain thinking in new ways.

Ideas for creativity: What are some examples?
Creativity is often thought of as a source of inspiration and a way to come up with new ideas. However, creative ideas can also be generated through creativity itself. Here are some examples: 
1. Thinking outside the box – When you come up with new ideas, it’s important not to be afraid to be creative. This can mean thinking about things that you’ve never thought of before or coming up with ways to improve upon what others have already done. 
2. Taking risks – If you’re looking for new ways to get your creative juices flowing, always take some risks. This means trying out different concepts or concepts that you might not have considered before. It can also involve taking on tasks that are too much for you to complete easily or challenging yourself in order to force yourself to think outside the box and come up with new ideas.
