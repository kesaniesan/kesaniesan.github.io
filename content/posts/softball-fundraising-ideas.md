What are the benefits of having ideas?
Ideas can be a big help when it comes to solving problems. Ideas can also help you see things in a new light or come up with new ideas for projects. There are many benefits to having ideas and some people swear by the power of them. Here are three reasons why you should try out ideas at least once: 
- When you have an idea, it can force you to think about what else could be done. This can lead to new ideas, which in turn can lead to new projects. 
- Ideas are often more efficient than what is currently being done. When you have an idea, you can get started on it even if it’s not perfect and that makes the process of learning more efficient. 
- Ideas give people the opportunity to share their thoughts and opinions with others.

properties of innovation:
Innovation is a process of change that occurs when a new idea, product or service becomes more popular than the existing ones. Innovation can be seen as an exciting opportunity for businesses to create new products and services that improve their customers’ lives. The key to success in innovation is to have a strong vision and plan for the innovation, which can be difficult if the business does not have enough resources or if it does not have the rightpeople on board.
Innovation is often associated with technological progress, but it can also take place in other industries such as architecture and engineering. In architecture, innovation can take place in the design of buildings and infrastructure, as well as in the development of new technologies and marketing strategies.

Conclusion
After spending hours brainstorming and developing your invention idea, it's finally time to reach a conclusion. Here are a few things to keep in mind as you wrap up your project:
1. Make sure you have a clear understanding of the problem you're trying to solve. If you can't articulate the problem, you won't be able to sell your invention idea to others.

2. Do your research! Inventors who are well-informed about their industry and their competition are more likely to be successful. Make sure you know what's already out there and what needs improvement.

3. Have realistic expectations for your invention idea. It's important to be confident in your idea, but remember that not every great idea will become a multimillion-dollar business. Be prepared for bumps in the road and set reasonable goals for yourself and your team.
