In a society saturated with information, it can be difficult to find new ideas. Some people believe that the only way to find new ideas is to start from scratch. Others prefer to take existing ideas and improve on them. Still others think that ideas are like seeds - you must water them and let them grow before harvesting them. It all depends on what your goal is.

Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

The Key: What are the essential steps in the creative process?
Creative ideas are like seeds. They can be sown in any direction, but they will eventually germinate and produce a flower. The key to success when it comes to creative ideas is to have a clear plan for how you want the idea to turn into a reality. Once you have a good Idea, the next step is to come up with specific details that will make it real. You need to know what your target market is, what your competition is, and what your goals are. Once you have all of these details nailed down, it's time to start planning the execution. You'll need to create a timeline, set up funding sources, and get started on developing your idea. If all of this sounds like too much work, don't worry! There are plenty of resources available online that can help you get started on your creative journey.
