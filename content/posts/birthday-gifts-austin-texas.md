Ideas for health care: What can we do to improve access to health care?
There are many ways to improve access to health care, but some of the most common solutions include creating more affordable and accessible clinics and hospitals, expanding Medicaid, and improving the quality of care available through the Veterans Affairs system. There are also many ideas for reform that can be proposed in order to improve the overall experience for patients who use health care services. For example, a program that provides free preventive services could help reduce the number of doctor visits and hospitalizations related to health problems. Another idea is to tryouts for new medical treatments in order to find which ones work best on a individual basis.
