Innovation: What is it, and how can it be used?
Invention Ideas

There are many ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most common ways is through innovation. Innovation can be a result of anything that can make life better or easier, from improving on existing technologies to coming up with a new way of doing something. Inventors often come up with innovative ideas when they're stuck and need to come up with something that works or that's easier to do.

One of the best things about innovation is that it can help solve problems. Not all inventions are created equal, and there are different types of patents and trademarks that are used in the business world. Patenting an invention allows others to use your idea for free, so you can make more money off of it while still being able to keep some control over your work. trademarks are another way to get other people's attention and help promote your invention.
