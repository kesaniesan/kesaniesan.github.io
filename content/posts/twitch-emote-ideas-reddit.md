Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:

More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

The benefits and drawbacks of DIY projects
There are many benefits to DIY projects, including the satisfaction of completing something yourself. However, there are also some drawbacks to DIY projects, which can include a lack of knowledge or experience, and even mistakes. Here are four tips for avoiding common pitfalls when creating your own DIY project:
1. Do your research first: When starting a DIY project, it’s important to do your research before starting any project. You don’t want to spend hours trying to figure out how something works only to have it go wrong later on. By doing your research, you can save yourself time and headaches in the long run.

2. Be patient: Don’t be discouraged if you don’t understand something right away. If you can be patient and continue reading instructions, you will eventually get the hang of things.

Brainstorming techniques
When it comes to brainstorming, there are a variety of techniques that can be used in order to generate new ideas. One popular technique is known as brainwriting, which involves writing down ideas on paper or in a digital document. This can be done individually or in a group setting.
Another common brainstorming technique is known as mind mapping. This involves creating a visual representation of ideas, often using colors and images. This can help to stimulate the creative part of the brain and can be used to organize thoughts in a more logical manner.

Lastly, brainstorming can also be done through problem-solving techniques such as SCAMPER. This acronym stands for Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, and Reverse/Rearrange.
