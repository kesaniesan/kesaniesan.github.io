The Importance of Innovation in the Economy: What are some benefits to businesses that embrace innovation?

Definition of creativity: How do we define creativity?
Creativity is a relative term. Many people believe that creativity = doing something new and original. Others would say it's the ability to come up with ideas or solutions that no one else has thought of before. The definition for creativity has changed over time, but the process remains the same- coming up with new and innovative ways to do things. Whether it’s painting, designing, or writing, creative individuals have always been able to bring their A game to whatever they do.

Businesses that are able to innovate and embrace change are able to grow their businesses faster and achieve success. Innovation can be done in a number of ways, but some of the most common methods include:
1. Bringing in new ideas – whether it’s from outside of the company or from within itself. This can help businesses see new possibilities and come up with innovative ways to improve their products or services.

2. Applying cutting-edge technology – again, whether it’s from outside of the company or from within themselves. With technology becoming more and more complex every day, innovation is key in being able to keep up with the changing trends.

3. Updating old methods – again, this could come from outside of the company or inside themselves if they’re using outdated processes or tools.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
