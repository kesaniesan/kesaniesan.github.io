A few Tips for Using Brainstroming to Improve Your Life
Brainstroming can help improve your thinking and productivity, especially if you're struggling with a specific problem or goal. Here are a few tips for using brainstroming to get started: 
1. Get organized: Brainstroming can help you focus on one task at a time, which can make it easier to succeed at your goal. Keep track of your thoughts and ideas in an easily accessible place, and use that information to jumpstart your brainstorming process. 

2. Take some time for yourself: Brainstorming is a great way to clear your head and come up with new ideas. However, don't work on your project for hours on end – set some limits and let the brainstorming process take its course.

the nature of innovation and how it leads to change
Innovation is a central part of the puzzle that leads to change. It’s a process of taking something that’s working well and making it better. Innovation can be seen in everything from products to services to business models. But what makes innovation work is often more difficult than people think. Here are four examples of how innovation can lead to big changes in our world.
1) New technologies lead to new ways of doing things. When you introduce a new technology into an industry, you may see companies come up with new ways of doing things such as creating digital products or services that are easier and faster to use than ever before. This can change the way customers approach their businesses, and it can also lead to new markets for products and services.

2) Innovative business models help companies find new ways to make money.
