How can we turn big ideas into real projects?
How can we turn big ideas into real projects? There are a few key strategies that can help. First, we need to identify the big idea. Once we know what it is, our next step is to develop a plan for how to make it a reality. Once we have a plan, it’s time to gather the resources necessary to make it happen.
