What are some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to new ideas?
New ideas are always risky, so it’s important to be aware of some of the most common pitfalls when it comes to coming up with them. These include: not being able to see the potential positives, overestimating how much work is required, failing to anticipate resistance from others, and underestimating how much feedback is needed before anything can be put into practice. If you’re ever feeling lost when it comes to creating new ideas, take a step back and think about what worked for others before you try something new.
