Invention of the World Wide Web
In 1839, Nicholas-Jacques Conte wrote a paper on the idea of a world wide web, which would eventually be called the Internet. The first real steps were made in 1947 when Claude Shannon and others developed the theory of information theory, which allowed for the Transmission of Information over Communications Channels. The following year, IBM created an electronic computer called Punchy, which was used to test communication protocols on. In 1951, Xerox PARC developed the Alto computer system that could be connected to a network. On August 29th of that year, US president Harry Truman announced his plan to create the American National Telecommunications Commission (ANTC), which would control all federal telecommunications regulations. This was the beginning of what is now known as the Internet era.

Invention: What are its different forms?
Invention is the process of creating something new, whether it is a new product or a new method of doing something. Inventions often differ in form, but they all share one common goal: to improve society. There are many different types of inventions, but the most common are products and methods. Product inventions are those that make something better than what was before, while method inventions involve coming up with a new way to do something. As technology advances, so too will the variety of invention potential. But no matter what type of invention you come up with, there is always a potential for improvement.
