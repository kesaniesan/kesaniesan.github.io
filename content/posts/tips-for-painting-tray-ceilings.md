For example, the big idea of evolution has helped us to understand the diversity of life on Earth and our place in the natural world. The big idea of gravity has helped us to understand how the universe works. And the big idea of relativity has helped us to understand the nature of time and space.



Big ideas can also change the way we see ourselves and our place in the world. The big idea of human rights, for example, has helped us to understand that all people are equal and deserving of respect. The big idea of democracy has helped us to understand that everyone should have a say in how they are governed.
