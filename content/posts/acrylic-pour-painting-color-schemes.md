Conclusion
Innovation is not a new concept. It has been around since the beginning of time. However, it has only recently become a buzzword in the business world.
Innovation is the process of taking an idea and turning it into a reality. It is about creating something new or improving upon something that already exists. Innovation can be big or small. It can be something as simple as a new way to make a cup of coffee or as complex as developing a new form of renewable energy.

There are four main types of innovation: product, process, business model, and social. Product innovation is about creating new products or improving upon existing ones. Process innovation is about improving the way things are done. Business model innovation is about changing the way businesses operate. Social innovation is about solving social problems in new and innovative ways.

What is invention?
Invention is the process of coming up with a new idea, product, or service that was not previously thought of. Inventions can come in many forms, from small ideas to huge leaps in technology. Some inventions are so important that they have changed the way the world works, such as the computer and telephone. Others are simply bizarre, like a Bob-omb that can walk and talk. But no matter what form an invention takes, it is an essential part of our society and economy.
