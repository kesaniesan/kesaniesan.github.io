The Use of Invention: What are some examples?
Invention is the use of a creative idea, or a new method or process, to produce a product or service. Invention can come from anywhere: in your mind, in your backyard, on the internet, or even from someone you know. 
There are many examples of invention. For example, think about the wheel- an invention that changed the way we move around. There are also inventions that have had huge impacts on society and the world like the telephone, antibiotics, and jet engines- all of which were invented by people who were not just working on their own but were part of a team. 
Inventions can be really amazing or really terrible. But they always have a big impact because they help us do things that we couldn't do before and they make our lives easier.

Why do we need to have big ideas?
There are a number of reasons why we need to have big ideas. 
1. Ideas can help solve problems. A big idea can be a solution to a problem that wasn't possible before. 
2. Idea generation can make us smarter. When we have ideas, we can learn from others and become better thinkers. 
3. Idea management is important for startups and businesses. Having a good idea is essential for any startup or business, as having too many ideas will lead to lower productivity and less success. 
4. Idea theft is a problem! Not everyone has the same idea for their business or product and someone else may have an idea that is better than your own and steal your idea without you realizing it. 
5. Idea culture is important for businesses!
