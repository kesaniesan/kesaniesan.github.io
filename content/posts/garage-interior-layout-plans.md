The power of creativity: What does it mean for business?
Creativity is key to businesses. Without creativity, businesses couldn't exist. However, what does it mean for business? 
Creativity can be defined as the ability to come up with new ideas or solutions to problems. This can be done through brainstorming, creative thinking, or simply coming up with different options and concepts. 

However, creativity also has to be used wisely. Too much creativity can lead to a lack of focus and productivity in a business. And too little creativity can also lead to boredom or stagnation. 

So while creativity is key to businesses, it's also important that businesses use it in a responsible manner. Otherwise, they could get left behind in the competitive race for innovation.
