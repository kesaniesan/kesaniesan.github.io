Types of creativity: Visual, auditory, kinaesthetic, and gestural.
Creativity is a two-fold process. There are creative visual and auditory experiences, as well as creative gestural experiences. Gestural creativity refers to the ability to create unique or innovative designs through the use of gestures. Gestural creativity can be seen in artists such as Michelangelo and Vincent van Gogh, who were known for their innovation in artistry. Visual creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using their eyesight and vision. This can be seen in paintings such as Leonardo da Vinci’s Mona Lisa, Caravaggio’s The Nude Descending from the Cross, and Picasso’s Guernica. Artists use their eyesight to see what they want to create, and then use their imagination to make it real. Audiogenic creativity is when an artist creates a piece of art by using sound instead of sight.

Tips for starting a DIY project: What do you need before beginning?
There are a few things you need before beginning your DIY project. These include a level, a hammer, screws, nails, and an armoire. Here are some tips to help you get started:
1. Level the surface area of the work surface to ensure accuracy.
2. Choose a Hammer that is the Right Size for Your Project. A larger hammer will be more powerful and will take more time to smooth out the surface of the wood. A smaller hammer may have better speed but will leave more marks on the wood.
3. Nail The Work Surface To The Wall or Floor First. This will prevent mess and make it easier to handle your project later on when nails are needed.
4. Screw The Work Surface To The wall or Floor After You nail it down (If using a floor).
