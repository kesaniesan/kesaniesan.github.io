Concluding thoughts on big ideas.
In recent years, big ideas have come to the forefront of many people's minds. Some of these innovative concepts are new and exciting, while others are more general in nature but still important in terms of advancing humanity. In this article, we will take a look at two key ideas that have received a lot of attention in recent years- artificial intelligence and digital citizenship. 
Artificial intelligence is one big idea that has been receiving a lot of attention recently. Many experts believe that this technology can be used to create intelligent machines that can do a majority of the work for us- from cleaning and grocery shopping to driving and making decisions on things like politics and industry.

The creative process: How does one go about coming up with an invention?
Invention ideas come to us in all forms- written, verbal, or graphical. Some people start with the idea of what they want to create and then work backwards from there. Others have a pure invention idea that is completely new and has no precedent within the industry. There is no right or wrong way to come up with an invention, as long as it's creative and futuristic. The process of coming up with an invention begins by brainstorming different ideas on paper or on a computer. Once you've collected a few good ideas, it's time to get them down on paper or in your head for further thought. Once you've created some rough sketches, it's time for refinement and development. The next step is testing- doing research on the subject matter you're consideringbefore submitting your product to market.
