The risks and benefits of implementing big ideas.
Big ideas are important for businesses and individuals because they can help make large changes in how we live, work, and spend our time. However, implementation of big ideas can be risky and difficult. Here are four key dangers to avoid:
1. Losing sight of the goal: When a business or individual begins to focus on implementing a big idea, they may forget the main reason they created the idea in the first place- to make a difference in people’s lives. Once theirmain objective has been achieved (and often not easily), they may start thinking about other things instead of delivering on their original promise.

2. Failing to deliver on expectations: Big ideas often involve significant changes that could have a significant impact on both people and businesses if not executed flawlessly.

How to come up with big ideas
When it comes to coming up with big ideas, the first step is to have a clear idea of what you want your business to achieve. Once you know what you want, it's time to start thinking about how you can achieve it. Here are four tips for coming up with big ideas: 
1. Look at your industry and think about how you could improve it. Why isn't there enough innovation in this industry? Why are some products more popular than others? What could be done to make sure that your product or service is better?
2. Come up with a goal that you can focus on and work towards. This will help give you the motivation to keep going when the going gets tough. Without a goal, it's hard to stay motivated and keep exploring new ideas. 
3. Make a list of possible ways that your business could improve.
