The Types of Ideas: What are the three main types of creative ideas?
Creative ideas are everywhere. They can be found in everything from advertising to architecture to the arts. But what are the three main types of creative ideas? Here are a few examples:
1. Product idea: A product is an idea that a business or individual has for selling its product. A product can be something as simple as a new phone case or a new restaurant dish.

2. Concept idea: A concept is an idea that a business or individual has for creating a new product or service. Concepts can be anything from innovative to unique to futuristic.

3. Design idea: A design is an idea that comes after someone has created some sketches and drawings of what they want their product or service to look like. Designs can range from simple to complex, and they can also be based on existing products or services.

How to come up with great ideas?
Ideas can be everything from creative to helpful, and they come in all shapes and sizes. To come up with great ideas, it's important to think outside the box. Here are four tips to help you get started:
1. Try different methods: When you have a good idea, don't just sit down and write it down. You might want to try thinking about it from a different perspective or using different language.

2. Get feedback: Take some time to get feedback from people who know what you're trying to do. They might have some great ideas of their own that you can use as a starting point.

3. Be open to change: If your idea is great, but it's not working for someone else, don't be afraid to make changes.
