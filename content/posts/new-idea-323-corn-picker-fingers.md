What is innovation and why do we need it?
Innovation is the ability to come up with new ways of doing things. It can be in the form of a new product, service, or idea. Innovation is important because it gives businesses and individuals the chance to try something and see if it works or not.
There are a few different types of innovation: scientific, technological, economic, social and cultural.

Technical innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make products or services more efficient or effective. Economic innovation happens when companies or governments find new ways to make money by selling their products or services. Social innovation happens when people come up with ideas for different organizations or societies that could benefit from them.

Commercialization: How can inventors develop their inventions into successful businesses?
There are a variety of ways to turn inventions into successful businesses, depending on the inventor and the business opportunity. 
One way is for an inventor to commercialize their invention. This can be done through a variety of ways, including selling the invention to a company, licensing the invention, or working with a business to help develop new products or services. 

Another way is for an inventor to work on their invention full time and then sell their product when it becomes available. This is an option if the inventor has a strong idea for a product or service that they believe could be successful. However, it can be difficult to make money from an invention this way. 
The third way is for an inventor to find someone who has an existing product or service that they could use as a model for their own product.
