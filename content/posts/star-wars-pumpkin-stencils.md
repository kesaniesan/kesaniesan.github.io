Causes of change in the economy and society: Innovation leads to change.
Innovation is always a driving force for change in the economy and society. There are many reasons why innovation can lead to changes in behavior, products, services, and even entire industries. 
Some of the primary reasons for innovation are to help businesses succeed more efficiently and faster; to create new consumer demand; to increase production; and to improve efficiency. 

But there are other factors as well, such as the need for new ideas or approaches when it comes to solving problems or meeting needs. When these come together, they can result in radical change in an industry or society.

For example, Google was founded on the idea of bringing search results from different sources together so people could find what they were looking for quickly and easily. This led them to develop a variety of search engines that continues to be a mainstay on the internet today.
