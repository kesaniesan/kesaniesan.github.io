Often times, innovation comes from scratch – a new idea that is sparked by an idea someone has. In business, innovation can mean the creation of a new product or service that is better than what was available before.

Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries.
