The brainstroming phenomenon is when people's thoughts track the same topic for a sustained period of time. In some cases, this can be an extended period of time - for example, if someone has been thinking about the same subject constantly for a few days or weeks. In other cases, it may be more sporadic - for example, if someone thinks about the same topic once and then doesn't think about it for a week or two.

Trends in artificial intelligence (AI): What new sources of AI will we see in the next few years?
AI is becoming more and more pervasive in our daily lives, with a number of startups and companies working on various AI projects. Some of the most important trends that are expected to take place in the next few years include:
1. More automated intelligent agents – This trend is already being seen in some industries, such as retail, where machines are increasingly able to carry out tasks that used to be carried out by human beings. The hope is that this will eventually lead to increased efficiency and savings for businesses.

2. Machine learning – This field is rapidly developing and has the potential to change many aspects of our lives, from business to healthcare. It involves building algorithms that can learn from data and make decisions on their own. This could lead to huge improvements in our understanding of the world around us, as well as new ways of detecting and responding to dangerous situations.

The definition of creativity: How does it differ from other definitions?
Creativity is a field that encompasses many different definitions, but all of them share one common goal: to produce something new. Whether it’s creativity in the creative process itself or what people mean when they use the word, creativity can be defined in many ways. 
There are many different ways to define creativity, but all of them outline four core concepts: 1) The ability to take inspiration from others and create something new; 2) The ability to come up with solutions that haven’t been tried before; 3) The willingness to experiment and try new things; and 4) The drive to learn and grow. 

The definition of creativity can be very different depending on who you ask, but all of these core concepts are key when examining how creativity is defined in the world.
