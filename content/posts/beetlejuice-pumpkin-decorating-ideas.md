5) Use natural light to boost productivity
Light is one of the most important things in a person's life. It can help you focus, read, and do your work better. There are many ways to use natural light to boost productivity. Here are 5 tips:
1) Get a window that opens up onto natural light. This will allow you to get plenty of exposure to the sun.
2) Use sunlight exposure clocks to time your work periods so you can work more effectively in the morning and at night.
3) Make use of windows with high-quality blinds or curtains that block out all light. This will keep you productive while working in darkness.
4) Use a desk lamp rather than traditional office lights. This will allow you to see what you're working on more clearly and avoid eyestrain.
