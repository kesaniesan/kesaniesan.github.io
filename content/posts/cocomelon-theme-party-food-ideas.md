The history of invention: How have some inventions been used and what benefits have they brought?
Invention ideas are a core part of the history of technology. From ancient times to the present, people have come up with new ways to do things. Some inventions have been helpful and others have not. The history of invention is full of examples of both. Here are three examples:
The incandescent light bulb was first invented in 1879 by Jewish inventor Samuel Morse. It used a filament that was heated by an oven to create light.
