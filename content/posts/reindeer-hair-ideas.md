What is innovation?
Innovation is the process of making something new, or changing something existing. Innovation can be defined in many ways, but one common definition is that it is "the act or process of converting a potential failure into a successful outcome." 
It can be seen as a way to improve the quality and efficiency of an organization's operations, as well as create new opportunities for business growth. 
The key to success in any innovation endeavor is ensuring that the innovation does not detract from the company's primary focus, which may be its core business.

How do we create innovative products?
Innovation is the ability to create new products or services that solve a problem that was not previously considered. For some businesses, innovation can come from coming up with a new way to do something, getting better at what you do, or even creating something entirely new. In other cases, innovation can come from taking an existing product and making it better. Sometimes this is easy- like when a business comes up with a new way to make their product more efficient- and sometimes it takes more effort, like when a company comes up with a revolutionary new technology. Innovation is important because it allows businesses to stay ahead of the curve and give their customers the best possible experience.
