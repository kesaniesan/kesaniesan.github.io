The Process of Idea Generation: How do you come up with ideas?
Ideas are important, because they can help you bring about changes in your life or in the lives of others. However, it can be tough to come up with ideas. There are a few key factors that can help you generate more ideas. The first is to have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve. If you don’t know what you want, it’s hard to come up with ideas for it. The second factor is to be persistent. If you start thinking about something and not doing anything about it, the likelihood of carrying out your idea will increase. The third factor is to have a great idea. This requires both creativity and originality. If an idea is well-developed but not original, others may be more likely to adopt it. Lastly, make sure your idea is feasible.

How to have more creative ideas: methods for improving your creativity
If you're looking for ways to be more creative, try these methods:
1. Get organized. This may seem counter-intuitive, but being organized can actually help you be more creative. When everything is in its place, you can focus your energy on generating new ideas instead of wasting time looking for things.

You may be surprised at how refreshed and ready to think creatively you feel when you return to your project.

Invention history: How did some of the earliest inventions get started?
Inventions have a long and complicated history, with some getting started much earlier than others. Here are some of the most notable inventions, starting with the oldest:
The first true computer was built in the late 17th century by Johannes Gutenberg, who used a printing press to create movable type. The printing press had potential to spread literacy and knowledge far beyond the small town where Gutenberg resided.

Invention ideas are often hatched out of boredom or frustration. In 1823, Charles Babbage designed a machine that could solve problems in mathematics that had never been solved before. The machine was code-named Analytical Engine and it was not completed until 1831.

But even the earliest machines didn’t always get results they were hoping for.
