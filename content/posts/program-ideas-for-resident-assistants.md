The Benefits of Thinking Out Loud: How to get started
With so many things going on in our lives, it can be difficult to focus. It's easy to forget that we have the power to think and change the world. Here are a few ideas to get you started: 
1) Get organized. When you're not focusing, it can be difficult to stay on track with your goals. Make a list of your top accomplishments and objective, and then find ways to achieve them through effort and planning. 
2) Take action. Sometimes all it takes is taking some action towards your objective- even if it's just writing down what you plan to do next. This will help keep you motivated as well as give yourself an idea of how far you've come already. 
3)「What if?」 Thinking about possibilities can help increase your confidence when making decisions.

The benefits and drawbacks of DIY projects
There are many benefits to DIY projects, including the satisfaction of completing something yourself. However, there are also some drawbacks to DIY projects, which can include a lack of knowledge or experience, and even mistakes. Here are four tips for avoiding common pitfalls when creating your own DIY project:
1. Do your research first: When starting a DIY project, it’s important to do your research before starting any project. You don’t want to spend hours trying to figure out how something works only to have it go wrong later on. By doing your research, you can save yourself time and headaches in the long run.

2. Be patient: Don’t be discouraged if you don’t understand something right away. If you can be patient and continue reading instructions, you will eventually get the hang of things.
