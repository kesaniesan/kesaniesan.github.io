Conclusion: Some things to consider before you come up with new ideas.
When you come up with new ideas, it's important to consider what the idea means to you. Do you think it will help solve a problem? Are there other ideas out there that could work better? If so, why not go for it? However, if the answer is no and the idea isn't something that excites or interests you, don't go ahead and try it. There are a lot of great ideas out there and sometimes the best thing to do is just give up.
