How to have big ideas
The ability to have big ideas is a skill that can be learned and cultivated. Here are some tips on how to have big ideas:
1. Be open to new ideas and perspectives. Don't be afraid to explore different viewpoints and challenge your own assumptions.

2. Pay attention to your surroundings and the world around you. Look for patterns and connections that you may not have noticed before.

3. Be willing to take risks. Big ideas often come from thinking outside the box and taking risks. So don't be afraid to try something new or different.

4. Be persistent and never give up. Many great ideas come after many failed attempts. So keep trying and never give up on your dreams or goals.

5. Surround yourself with other creative people.

Developing Your Idea: Once you have an idea, how do you develop it into a functional product?
If you have an invention idea, you may be wondering how to develop it into a functional product. The first step is to do some research and make sure your idea is unique. You can search online patent databases or contact a patent attorney to help you with this process.
Once you have determined that your idea is new and novel, the next step is to start developing it. This may involve creating a prototype or working with a manufacturer to produce a working model of your invention. The key is to keep moving forward and not get bogged down in the details.

With perseverance and a little luck, you can turn your invention idea into a reality. Just remember to take things one step at a time and always consult with experts when necessary.

The Problem: How do we create meaningful ideas?
In order to create meaningful ideas, we need a strong understanding of what those ideas mean and how to put those ideas into practice. Unfortunately, most people lack these foundational skills. In order to get started, here are some basic tips: 
1. Think about what you want your idea to achieve. This will help you determine how your idea can be used and adapted. 
2. Brainstorm with others for feedback andIdea generation challenges can be fun, but also helpful in getting feedback on whether or not your idea is conceptually good or bad. 
3. Come up with a working title for your idea before you even start thinking about it. This will give you an idea of what the word “idea” means and make sure that everyone who hears your idea understands it at its purest form (i.e., without any additional context).
