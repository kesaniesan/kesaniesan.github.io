What are the major trends in ideas for 2022?
In 2022, many ideas for change and innovation will be on the horizon. Some of the most important trends include: escalated automation, quantum computing, artificial intelligence (AI), and big data. 
This year's International Astronautical Congress (IAC) is a good time to think about ways to embrace these new technologies and see what potential applications they can offer. This conference will also provide valuable insights into which countries are leading the way in these fields and how they plan to address 2030 challenges.

The future of technology is always up for grabs and with that, the potential for new ideas. Some of the latest and most innovative technologies are those that don't involve traditional methods like combustion or electric current. Instead, they rely on something entirely different- microwaves and lasers. These two technologies are seen as breakthroughs in the field of technology because they offer a whole new way to achieve certain goals.
