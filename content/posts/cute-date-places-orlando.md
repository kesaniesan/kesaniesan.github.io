Creative people often think about their work in terms of how it can contribute to the world. They may be visual, auditory, or touch based, but all creativity has in common is that it comes from within. Creative people are important not just because they can create things, but also because they can share their ideas and thoughts with others. Whether it’s through art, activism, or simply making new friends, creativity is essential for creating a better future.
