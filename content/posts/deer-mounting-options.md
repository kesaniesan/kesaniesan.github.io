The future of jobs
In the year 2022, many jobs will be gone and replaced by "virtual" jobs. These jobs will not require any physical labor, but instead rely on computational power and other technological advancements. The virtual job market is growing rapidly, and companies are starting to see the potential in it. They are looking to create new, cutting-edge virtual jobs that can keep employees engaged and entertained. Here are five ideas for what future virtual jobs might look like: 
1. Virtual reality technology could be used to create realistic 3D replicas of different workplaces. This would allow employees to experience different aspects of their job at home, making them more likely to stay with a company longterm. 
2. Virtual assistants could be used as general support staff in businesses.
