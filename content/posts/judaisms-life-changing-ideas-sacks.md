Innovation is the process of creating or expanding new ideas, products, or services. Innovation takes many different forms, from the invention of a new product to the development of a new way of doing business. In some cases, innovation can be based on the observation of what works and what doesn’t in the past. In other cases, innovation can come about through the use of technology or outside help.

Impact of Innovation: What are some benefits to companies who embrace innovation?
Innovation is a key component of businesses that thrive. It allows companies to release new ideas and products faster, improve their efficiency and create new services or products. There are many benefits to companies who embrace innovation, but here are some of the most important: 
1. Increased Efficiency - Innovations allow companies to save time and money by productizing existing ideas or by creating new concepts that were not possible before. This can lead to increased profits and sustainability because it reduces the amount of time needed to produce a product or service. 
2. Improved Productivity - Innovation also helps businesses to produce more efficiently because it allows them to focus on certain tasks instead of having to spend time developing every aspect of their product or service. This can lead to higher levels of productivity and accuracy in their work, which is essential for businesses that rely on customer satisfaction and profitability.

Innovation also drives economic growth, which in turn creates jobs. However, innovative actions can also lead to negative outcomes, such as loss of jobs or the displacement of workers. In order to ensure positive outcomes for businesses and economies, it is important for policymakers to identify and focus on innovation.
