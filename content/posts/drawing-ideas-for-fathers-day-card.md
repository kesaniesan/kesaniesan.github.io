4th idea:
There are a lot of ideas out there. How do you know which ones are worth pursuing? And how do you come up with new ideas in the first place?
Here are four ways to come up with better ideas:

1. Be open to new experiences

If you want to have more and better ideas, you need to be open to new experiences. That means trying new things, meeting new people, and exposing yourself to new ideas. The more experiences you have, the more material you have to work with when it comes time to generate new ideas.

2. Be persistent

Coming up with good ideas is hard work. Don't expect to have a great idea every time you sit down to brainstorm. It takes time, effort, and a lot of trial and error. The key is to keep at it until you find that one winning idea.

Creativity is one of the most important elements in life. It can help us think differently, come up with new ideas, and improve our productivity. However, sometimes creativity can get in the way of things we want to achieve. For example, some people may find it difficult to be creative when they're not used to thinking out loud or when they don't have a lot of experience with brainstorming.
