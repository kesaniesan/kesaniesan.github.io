Ideas are things that get your mind going and can help you solve problems. There are many different types of ideas, but these are the three most common:

2. The creative idea: This is an external perspective on something that you've already been thinking about or working on. It can help you come up with a new solution or approach to a problem.

3. The problem-solving idea: This is the mental construct that helps you see how everything works together to create a single goal or solution.
