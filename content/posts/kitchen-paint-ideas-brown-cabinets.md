Defining ideas
When it comes to ideas, there is no one-size-fits-all definition. Ideas can come in many different forms, and they can be used for a variety of purposes.
Some people might think of ideas as being nothing more than a thought or concept. Others might see them as being something that can be turned into a reality. Whatever your definition of ideas may be, there is no doubt that they are important.

Ideas can be the spark that starts a fire, or they can be the key to solving a problem. They can be the foundation for a new business or product, or they can simply help you see the world in a new way. No matter what their purpose is, ideas are essential for driving innovation and change.

Defining big ideas
There are a lot of big ideas out there. But what exactly are they? And how can we define them?
A big idea is an overarching concept or theme that is central to a work of art, literature, or philosophy. It is usually something that the author wants to communicate to the audience, and it can be interpreted in many ways.

One way to think of a big idea is as a symbol or motif that represents something larger than itself. For example, in the novel The Great Gatsby, the green light on Daisy Buchanan’s dock represents hope and possibility. In Shakespeare’s play Romeo and Juliet, the balcony scene is a symbol of young love and its potential for tragedy.

Another way to define a big idea is as an abstract concept that can be explored in different ways.
