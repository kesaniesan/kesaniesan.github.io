The history of innovation
Innovation is a core element of the American way of life and economy. Innovation has been a driving force in technological progress, economic growth, and social progress for centuries. However, there have been periods when innovation has not been as fruitful as others. One such period was the late 19th century when many innovative technologies were not adopted or developed as quickly as desired. Another period during the 20th century saw an increase in innovation but also a number of failures and setbacks. In the 21st century, there is an increasing focus on innovation as businesses and individuals are looking to find new ways to improve their products, services, and economies.
