What is innovation?
Innovation is the act of making a new and improved product or service. Innovation is key to businesses because it allows them to stay ahead of the curve, whether that means coming up with a new idea, developing a better product, or creating a new market niche. Innovation can also be seen as an indicator of success in a business. For example, Google was first to bring the internet to the masses in 1996 and Amazon has been selling books online for centuries. Despite these long histories, both entities have faced many challenges and have eventually become world-renowned companies.
