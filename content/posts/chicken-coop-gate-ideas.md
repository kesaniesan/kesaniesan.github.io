Invention process: How does an invention happen?
Invention ideas are a process that starts with a thought and progresses to the creation of a new product or service. The invention process can be described in four steps: Pre-production, Production, Market saturation, and Post-market.
Pre-production is when the inventor creates a rough idea of what they want their product or service to look like. This might include sketches, prototypes, or models.

Production is when the inventor makes the actual product or service. This might involve manufacturing it in physical form, shipping it to customers, and selling it.

Market saturation is when the public has become so familiar with the new product or service that they are willing to buy it. This might require creating more versions of the product or service, marketing them well, and making sure they are available at low prices.

Effects of innovation on society and businesses: How does innovation impact economic development?
Innovation is a key factor that has had a positive impact on society and businesses over the years. Some of the benefits include increased production, efficiency, and competitiveness.

Invention ideas: How to come up with new ideas?
There are countless ways to come up with new ideas, but one of the most effective methods is to brainstorm. By Brainstorming, you can come up with a number of different ideas that could potentially be turned into a successful product or business idea. Here are a few tips on how to brainstorm:
1. Start by thinking about what you know and what others have done. This will help you come up with ideas that are based on your experience and knowledge rather than on something that you think might be impossible.

2. Be open to new ideas and don’t be afraid to challenge yourself. If an idea sounds interesting, go ahead and pitch it to someone who might be willing to invest in it.

3. Be patient and don’t hurry things.
