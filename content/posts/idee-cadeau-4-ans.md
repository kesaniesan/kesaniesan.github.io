The impact of technology on the world: How does invention impact our lives?
Invention has always had an impact on the world. For example, Revolutionary War leader George Washington was inspired to start the country’s first papermaking industry after seeing a difference in how British officers printed papers. Invention has also impacted our lives in more recent times with advances in technology. For example, since the invention of the television, we have seen a rise in communication and entertainment options that have led to a more interconnected world. Additionally, new technologies are being developed constantly, which means that there is always potential for innovation and new ways of living.

Overcoming obstacles to thinking big
In order to think big, we must first overcome the obstacles that prevent us from doing so. These obstacles can be both internal and external.
Internal obstacles include self-doubt, negative thinking, and a lack of confidence. We must learn to silence our inner critic and believe in ourselves before we can achieve great things.

External obstacles include other people's negativity, skepticism, and doubt. When pursuing a big idea, it is important to surround yourself with positive people who will support and encourage you.

By overcoming these obstacles, we open ourselves up to limitless possibilities. Once we start thinking big, there is no telling what we can achieve.
