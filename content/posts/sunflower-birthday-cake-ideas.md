What are some big ideas?
1. Ideas for big changes or improvements can come from anything, but some things are more important than others. Examples of things that are more important include public opinion, financial stability, and the safety of our citizens.
2. A big idea can be something as small as making a change in how we operate our institutions or something as large as creating a new system that will work better for all involved. There is no right or wrong answer when it comes to big ideas, only what will make the world a better place.

Types of creativity: What are the types of creativity?
Creativity can be defined in many ways, but the most common definition is that creativity is the process of coming up with new ideas or visions. This definition could be used to describe almost any creative act, but art is an especially good example because it is often associated with creativity.
There are many types of creativity, but some of the most common are: visual, musical, and acoustic. Visual creativity includes thinking outside the box and coming up with original ideas or concepts. Musical creativity includes creating music that is unique and inspires emotions. Acoustic creativity includes creating sounds that are unique and inspire feelings or emotions. These three types of creativity are just a few examples; there are countless other creative acts that can be done without using these three specific terms.

If you think about it, Creativity seems like a pretty basic concept.
