How to brainstorm effectively.
1. When it comes to brainstorming, there are a few key things to keep in mind in order to make the process as effective as possible. 
2. First and foremost, itâ€™s important to create a relaxed and comfortable environment for everyone involved. This means no judgment, no pressure, and no distractions. 
3. Once you have the right setting, itâ€™s time to start generating ideas. The best way to do this is to encourage free-flowing thought and open-mindedness. 
4. Brainstorming sessions should be all about quantity over quality at first â€“ worry about filtering and refining later on. 
5. It can be helpful to have someone act as a facilitator during the session, keeping things on track and making sure everyone has a chance to share their ideas.

Thesis: There are a lot of new ideas out there, but what are the best ones?
The best new ideas come from a variety of sources, but some of the most promising concepts come from the fields of neuroscience and computer science. These two fields are providing researchers with innovative ways to study the human brain and provide insights into how we process information. In neuroscience, researchers are currently working on understanding how the brain functions and how it is changed by experience. This research could lead to new treatments for mental health problems and possible cures for diseases like Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. Meanwhile, in computer science, researchers are working on developing advanced virtual reality headsets and other gaming platforms that could revolutionize how people learn new skills. By understanding these two branches of research, scientists can develop better ideas for products and services that would be more effective or fun for users.
