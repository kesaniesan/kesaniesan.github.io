Since the beginning of time, there have been various ideas for how to improve society. Some of these ideas have been implemented and are working well, while others have not been successful and have had negative effects. One new idea is to create a government led program that would improve the economy by creating new jobs and making it easier to get credit. This would be a great solution because it would create more wealth and opportunities for people, and it would also reduce the amount of debt people carry.

Patenting an invention: How do you patent an invention?
Patenting an invention is a process of filing a patent application with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). This application can be filed in many different forms, but it is most commonly filed as a “patent application.”
When you file your patent application, you will need to provide a detailed description of your invention. This description will need to include everything from your name and contact information to the inventions that you are claiming. You will also need to provide enough evidence to support your claims.

Once you have submitted your patent application, the USPTO will review it and make any decisions necessary for approval. Once the USPTO approves your patent, you will then have to receive permission from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to sell or offer for sale your invention.
