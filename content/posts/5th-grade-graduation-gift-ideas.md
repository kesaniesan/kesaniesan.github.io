Ideas for Creativity: What works and what doesnâ€™t
Creativity is all about coming up with new and innovative ideas. However, it can be difficult to know what works and what doesn't. Here are some ideas for creativity that may work for you: 
1. Keep a journal or diary to help you keep track of your ideas and progress. This can be a great way to tape your thoughts and ideas together so that you can revisit them later on. 
2. Use creative software such as Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator to create digital illustrations, designs, or logos. These tools allow you to take your ideas and turn them into reality! 
3. Take on challenging projects that will force you to rethink your methods and strategies. This can include working on projects that are outside of your comfort zone, submitting original work to competitions, or simply trying something new once again!
