Improvements you can make yourself: How can you make your home more comfortable, stylish, and energy efficient?
When it comes to making your home more comfortable, stylish, and energy efficient, there are a few things you can do on your own. Here are some easy tips to make your home more comfortable and efficient: 
1. Make sure you have an adequate amount of ventilation. draperies and window coverings should be able to let in fresh air, which will help keep you cool and healthy.

2. Add light fixtures and appliances that can be turned off when not in use. This will save energy and help keep your room looking bright and cheerful during the daytime.

3. Get rid of unnecessary items in your home. Not everything needs to be owned or functional like a refrigerator or oven; find something that does not require electricity or space instead!

4. Add natural materials into your home décor for an eco-friendly look and feel.

Defining "big ideas"
What are "big ideas"? This is a question that has been asked throughout the history of education. The answer, however, is not always so clear.
One way to think of big ideas is as concepts that are essential for understanding a particular subject. For example, in mathematics, some big ideas include numbers and operations, patterns and relationships, and geometry and measurement. In science, some big ideas include energy and matter, waves and forces, and Earth and space.

The National Education Association's College and Career Readiness Standards also identify several big ideas in each content area. For example, in English Language Arts, the standards identify reading for knowledge and information; reading for literary experience; writing; speaking and listening; and language. In history/social studies, the standards identify civics and government; economics; geography; history;and social studies skills and methods.
