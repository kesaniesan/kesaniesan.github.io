Definitions of creativity: What do they mean to us?
Creativity is a subjective term that can be defined in many ways. For some, creativity means being able to come up with new and innovative ideas. For others, creativity may mean taking risks and trying new things. However, the definition of creativity does not end there. There are many different concepts surrounding creativity which can help us understand its meaning for ourselves.
One key concept around creativity is "the creative process." This refers to the way in which people approach their work, including how they come up with new ideas and how they create solutions to problems. The creative process can be broken down into three main steps: inspiration, ideation, and production. Inspiration comes from something that someone sees or hears, while ideation is when an idea is created without any prior thought or planning. Once an idea has been Ideated, it needs to be produced to make it a reality.
