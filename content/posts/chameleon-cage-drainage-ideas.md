Use of inventions in business: Why is this important?
invention ideas are important because they can help businesses save time and money. By using inventions, businesses can improve their products or services, slashed costs, and increased innovation. Here are three examples of how inventions have helped businesses: 
1. A key to a successful cosmetics company was the development of a new shade of lipstick that could be worn in all light colors. This led to the development of other popular shades, as well as new products such as lip balms and foundation kits. 
2. Another example is the development of a time-saving coffee maker that used drip coffee instead of pods. This led to lower costs for coffee and more efficient manufacturing processes.
3. The development of an air conditioning unit has allowed homes to be cooled much faster than previously possible. This has saved lives, particularly during summer heat waves.
