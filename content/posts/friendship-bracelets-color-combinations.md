Creative Abilities: What makes someone creative?
Creative abilities can be defined in many ways, but some common definitions include the ability to come up with ideas and concepts, as well as the ability to create things that are visually appealing or entertaining. It seems that creativity is a complex thing, and there is no one definition that fits everyone. However, what makes someone creative? Some people might say that creativity comes from being able to think outside the box, while others might say it comes from being able to think of new ideas or coming up with new solutions to old problems. Whatever the case may be, creativity is something that all humans have in abundance.
