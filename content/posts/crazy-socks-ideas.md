Creativity has been around for centuries, and it is no wonder that it has become so important in today’s society. In fact, creativity is often seen as one of the most underrated skills, as many people believe that creativity can only come from a certain type of mind. However, according to some researchers, creativity may actually be more common than we thought. In fact, creativity may even be more prevalent than originally thought. For example, research has shown that children as young as 2 years old are already capable of Civil War-era painting and poetry. And while many people believe that creativity comes from a “mental faculty” such as genius or IQ, this is not always the case. In fact, many people report feeling their creative juices flowing at an early age. So what is behind the resurgence of creativity?

conclusion
Writing can be a difficult and daunting task, especially when it comes to coming up with creative ideas. However, there are some ways to make the process easier and more fun. Here are three tips to help you get those creative juices flowing:
1. Get organized: This may seem like a no-brainer, but getting your ideas down in a organized fashion will help you immensely when it comes time to start writing. Having everything sorted out ahead of time will allow you to focus on the actual writing, rather than trying to come up with what comes next.

2. Take breaks: Sometimes the best way to come up with fresh ideas is to take a break from writing altogether. Go for a walk, listen to music, or just step away from your work for a few minutes.
