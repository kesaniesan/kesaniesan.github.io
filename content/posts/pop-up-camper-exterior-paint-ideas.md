The five types of creativity: Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal.
Intuitive, Analytical, Pluralistic, Formal, and Ultra-formal creativity are all important types of creativity. Intuitive creativity is based on the spontaneity of the creative process. Analyses provide a plan or blueprint for creative endeavors. Pluralistic creativity involves using many different ideas to come up with a new solution or project.

He came up with the design for the first jet engine in the 1920s, but it wasn't until he patented it that he got his name recognition and fortune.
