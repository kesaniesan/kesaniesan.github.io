Idea 4: What are some creative ways to get ideas from others?
Creative ways to get ideas from others have been around for centuries. Some people find inspiration in nature, others through friends, and still others through creativity itself.

1) Talk to your friends- prospective clients or customers can be great sources of inspiration when it comes to coming up with new ideas. Ask them what they think, what they’ve done that has inspired them, and see what you can borrow from their work. This could lead to new business opportunities or outright invention! 
2) Take on a project- if there’s something you’re passionate about, take on a project that speaks to that feeling.

Product/Service sections: What problems do you think need to be solved in order to make a better product or service?
There are a number of things that need to be solved in order to make a better product or service. One area where new ideas could help is in the area of customer service. Many people feel that the service that they receive when purchasing a product is not up to par and this is especially true when it comes to online services. This problem needs to be addressed in order for people to feel confident with their purchase. Another issue that needs to be solved is with the way products are offered. It can be difficult for customers to figure out what they are buying, especially when it comes to digital products. A solution could be to offer more information on each product, as well as give customers the ability to return any product if they are not satisfied.
